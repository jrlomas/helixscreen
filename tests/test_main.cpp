/// Pin every cache rung a test can reach into a per-run sandbox.
///
/// get_helix_cache_dir() used to be stubbed out of the test link by
/// tests/ui_test_utils.cpp, so a test could not reach the developer's real
/// cache no matter what it asked for. The real cascade is linked now
/// (src/system/helix_cache_dir.cpp) — which is the point, since the stub was a
/// two-rung fake that left rungs 2-7 untested — but it also means an unpinned
/// run resolves to $HOME/.cache/helix and writes there.
///
/// WHY A CONSTRUCTOR AND NOT A CATCH2 LISTENER: the cache directory is latched
/// by a Meyer's singleton, and tests/unit/test_isolation_listener.cpp reaches it
/// from testRunStarting() — it calls ThumbnailProcessor::instance() to pre-warm
/// the pool, and that constructor resolves and creates its cache dir on the
/// spot. Catch2 runs listeners in registration order, which across translation
/// units is static-init order and therefore unspecified, so a listener that
/// pins the environment is in a race it can silently lose. It did: the run
/// still wrote to $HOME/.cache/helix/helix_thumbs. Priority 101 is the earliest
/// user constructor priority, so this lands before all normal-priority dynamic
/// initialization and before any listener exists to be ordered against.
///
/// Two variables, because one does not cover it. HELIX_CACHE_DIR is rung 1, and
/// pinning it is enough for tests that leave it alone. The cases in
/// test_cache_dir.cpp that deliberately clear or blank it to exercise
/// fall-through would sail straight past into $HOME/.cache — XDG_CACHE_HOME
/// catches those at rung 4, which is consulted before home() at rung 5.
///
/// Both are set only when the caller has not already chosen a value, so a
/// developer or CI job pointing the suite somewhere specific still wins.
///
/// POSIX only (mkdir/snprintf/setenv): this runs before the C++ runtime is
/// fully warmed up, so it deliberately avoids anything that needs it.
