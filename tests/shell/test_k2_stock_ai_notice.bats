# Tests for print_k2_stock_ai_notice() in main.sh (#1378).
#
# Installing HelixScreen on a K2 stops the stock failure detection loop: the
# launcher hook stops and disables /etc/init.d/app (the procd service that runs
# Creality's Monitor/master-server/app-server detect loop), and the camera
# module hands /dev/video0 to ustreamer. HelixScreen ships its own detector for
# exactly this gap (K2StockDetectionSource, #1378). The notice has to say BOTH
# halves - the stock loop stops, and HelixScreen detection takes over - and
# these tests pin those claims.
