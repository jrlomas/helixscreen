# The constraint: qc_xml_const and qc_xml_attr guard on `[ -x build/bin/... ]`
# and skip when the binary is missing, and no ordinary build produces those
# binaries — `make` builds only the app. A gate whose tool nothing builds is a
# pass verdict that examines nothing, so the wiring that produces the tools is
# pinned here: one serial step, ahead of the parallel gate batch (two makes in
# one tree race on the object dir), failing red when the build fails.
