# Meta-tests for scripts/check_test_binary_current.sh, the predicate deciding
# whether the hidden test set is cheap enough to run on a commit.
#
# The predicate it replaces was `make -q`, which cannot ever succeed in this
# tree: src/system/helix_version.cpp is regenerated on every invocation for the
# git hash. The gate behind it printed "Test binary is stale - skipping" on
# every commit and ran nothing, which is how the [.] set rots unobserved.
#
# A stubbed make on PATH drives the plan, so these need no build and run on a
# bare checkout.
