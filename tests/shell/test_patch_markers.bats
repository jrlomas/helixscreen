#
# A marker is one line a patch adds (or removes) that upstream never
# contained, so "is this patch's effect in the checkout" becomes a plain text
# search. It must fail when a wired patch's effect is missing from a tree the
# patch stamp calls current, and it must stay silent on a healthy patched
# tree where the three-way apply verdict only warns because sibling patches
# moved shared context - the two checks answer different questions and must
# not share failure modes.
#
# Fixtures are rewritten whole with printf rather than edited with sed: BSD
# sed cannot insert newlines in a replacement, and these files are three
# lines long.
