# zeus-run.sh serializes jobs on the remote workdir (scripts/zeus-run.sh).
#
# A job resets the checkout and rebuilds in $WORKDIR on the container host, so
# two runs in that tree corrupt each other. The remote half of the script
# therefore takes an flock on the host before touching anything, and a second
# run waits, printing who holds the lock and since when. A build orphaned in
# the container by a run whose ssh side died holds no lock at all, so the
# run also polls the container for a live make before touching git.
#
# These tests stub ssh so the remote heredoc runs locally, and stub git,
# sudo and docker so nothing leaves the sandbox and no build runs; what is
# under test is the lock protocol itself. ZEUS_LOCK_DIR points the lock at
# the per-test sandbox, the same way ZEUS_WORKDIR and TMPDIR do.
#
# The tsan cases at the end pin that job's make target and its refusal to
# call a run with no test output clean.
