# Meta-tests for scripts/apply_submodule_patch.sh - the single apply verdict
# shared by every stanza in mk/patches.mk.
#
# The verdict must be three-way and honest: a patch either applies, is
# recognized as already applied by a reverse check, or is refused. An
# else-branch that prints "already applied" whenever `git apply --check`
# fails turns a dead patch into a green line, because the same non-zero exit
# covers "already applied" and "will never apply again". Only a from-clean
# run (HELIX_PATCHES_FROM_CLEAN=1, set by `make reapply-patches`) can judge
# the third case: there nothing is applied yet, so every patch must take its
# apply branch. Incremental runs warn instead of failing, because a sibling
# patch earlier in the same recipe may legitimately have moved the context a
# shared-file patch needs.
#
# The flag is a claim about the tree, and the claim is verified, not assumed:
# on a non-pristine checkout a healthy shared-file patch reads "neither" too,
# so there the fatal downgrades to the warn branch.
