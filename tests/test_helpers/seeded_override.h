/// File the lane records a stored override would have produced at load.

/// Every backend's on_started() pairs load_blocking() with
/// ingest_legacy_records(), so the application never holds an override whose
/// lane records are missing. A fixture that writes overrides_ alone models a
/// state the application cannot be in, and anything reading through the lane
/// model then sees an empty lane and leaves the backend's own values standing.
///
/// Routes each source through the funnel that source is allowed to use, and
/// classifies with the same pure sources_from_record() the real migration
/// uses, so a fixture cannot disagree with production about what a record
/// means.
///
/// The wire document is built by to_lane_data_record(), the same emitter
/// save_async writes through. Authorship is read off that document and not off
/// the struct: the lock keys and the declared set live there, and a record
/// classified against an empty object declares nothing at all, so a fixture
/// handing over one would test the unlocked path while believing it had seeded
/// a locked record. LegacyLockKeys::LaneData is the only spelling reachable
/// here because the emitter is the lane_data one, which is also the only
/// spelling any backend's ingest_legacy_records() passes.
///
/// A record this seeds still declares only what it carries. The lock flags
/// speak for colour and material; every other identity field answers to the
/// record's own declared set, so a brand on a record whose set is empty is
/// remembered rather than declared. A fixture that means a person typed the
/// brand wants edit_slot_as_user() below.
///
/// @p backend must be registered with AmsState, or lane_id() answers
/// INVALID_LANE_ID and the funnels drop every record. RegisteredBackend is how
/// a fixture gets that.
