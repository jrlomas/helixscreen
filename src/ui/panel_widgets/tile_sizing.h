/**
 * @brief Per-instance sizing for a centred-icon home tile
 *
 * Measures the tile's content in the faces it actually renders, decides with
 * decide_tile_layout(), and publishes the verdict as subjects XML binds
 * appearance to. One of these per widget INSTANCE, not per widget type: fan,
 * thermistor and power_device are multi-instance, and a type-global subject
 * would make the second instance overwrite the first's verdict so both tiles
 * agreed on whichever measured last.
 *
 * Construct it in the widget's CONSTRUCTOR. The manager creates a widget, then
 * calls lv_xml_create() on its component, and only then attach(). The XML
 * parser permanently skips a binding whose subject does not exist when the
 * component is parsed, silently and with nothing in the log, so subjects
 * registered from attach() would never bind and the tile would render at its
 * default appearance forever.
