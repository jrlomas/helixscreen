/**
 * @file fault_modal_registry.h
 * @brief Tracks alert modals that describe a fault ON THE PRINTER (#1266)
 *
 * An alert dialog is a statement about the world at the moment it was raised.
 * "Lost communication with MCU 'BoxTurtle'" stops being true the instant
 * Klipper comes back, and a dialog that outlives its condition is worse than no
 * dialog: it makes a healthy printer look broken, and a cascade of them has to
 * be dismissed one at a time before the screen is usable. Same lesson as #1185,
 * where the AMS error modal sat over a print that had already recovered.
 *
 * Registered dialogs are swept when the condition clears — in practice when
 * Klipper transitions back to READY, driven from EmergencyStopOverlay's
 * existing klippy_state observer.
 *
 * This lives in its own translation unit rather than inside ui_notification.cpp
 * because ui_notification.o is deliberately excluded from the test link
 * (mk/tests.mk — ui_test_utils.cpp stubs it), so anything defined there is
 * unreachable from a unit test. The registry is the part with actual logic, so
 * it belongs where tests can drive the real code.
