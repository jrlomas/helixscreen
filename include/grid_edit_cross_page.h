 * - Edge push: while the pointer stays in an edge zone the widget slides past
 *   where the pointer puts it, by the push speed times the time spent in the
 *   zone, capped CROSS_PAGE_PUSH_CAP_SLOP_PX past the majority line on either
 *   side. Leaving or changing zones drops the widget back on the pointer.
 * - Crossing: the widget's majority beyond a frame edge requests one flip
 *   toward it; the next crossing waits until the widget is majority inside.
 * - Dwell: runs while the pointer is in a zone, restarting on zone entry and
 *   stopping on exit.
 * - One flip per zone stay: a crossing stops the dwell, and a flip spends the
 *   zone for both triggers until the pointer leaves it. A dwell and a crossing
 *   therefore never chain two pages from one held push.
 *
 * @param state Carried between moves of one drag.
 * @param in The move.
 * @return What the drag applies.
