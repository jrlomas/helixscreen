//
// The record carries every identity field @p edited holds, because that is what
// the lane must show. Which of them the record claims as the USER'S word is a
// narrower question, and @p declaration answers it: a field is the user's
// exactly when they moved it, which user_edit_observation() works out from the
// editor's two snapshots. The editor seeds its working copy from the lane's
// current state, so a firmware-sourced brand, colour or material arrives in
// @p edited untouched, and a record claiming those would outrank the firmware
// that supplied them and refuse every later correction (#965).
//
// Authorship therefore lands in the declared set, from that one answer. A
// colour or material declaration needs a value to stand over, so an empty
// material is never declared however the edit moved it: every mirror policy
// leaves a declared field alone, and a declaration over nothing would stop
// firmware from ever filling that lane.
//
// @p prior is the record this lane already had, or nullptr for a lane with
// none. One edit speaks only about the fields it moved, so this edit's
// authorship is AMENDED onto that record's rather than replacing it: an
// earlier choice the edit never mentioned stays the user's word while the
// value it stood over is still the one the record holds. Without it a brand-
// only edit would drop a colour declared before it. An edit that changes the
// binding is the exception: a different spool is on the lane, so no earlier
// choice stands and the record declares only what that edit did.
// amend_authorship() (lane_translation.h) is that rule.
//
// `material` is recorded in place of edited.material, for a backend that
// persists firmware's normalized spelling rather than the string the user
// typed: AD5X stores the firmware-valid value its own normalize_material()
// produced, so the raw SlotInfo string is the wrong thing to record and the
// wrong thing to declare. Whether the material was declared still follows
// @p declaration, since the normalized spelling has no before-value to compare
// against. A record with a spool id records edited.material whatever `material`
// says: a linked spool owns its material, so the record keeps the spool's
// spelling while firmware receives the backend's own.
//
// The colour records only when it is a reading rather than the SlotInfo "no
// colour" sentinel, the question is_declarable_color() answers; a deliberate
// pure black (#000000) is a reading and records. color_name travels
// regardless, because it is the user's own text either way.
//
// Temps come from populate_temps_from_slot_info(). updated_at is left default
// so save_async stamps a fresh value.
