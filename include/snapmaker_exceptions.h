/**
 * @file snapmaker_exceptions.h
 * @brief The U1's structured fault codes, and what they mean to a user.
 *
 * The firmware raises faults with a module id, an index, a code and a level,
 * and embeds them in error text as `level-id-index-code`. Matching the English
 * sentence instead is brittle: the wording is the firmware's to change, and it
 * is not translated. The code is the stable identity.
 *
 * Levels mirror what the firmware will do about it: 1 nothing, 2 pause,
 * 3 cancel.
 *
 * The same faults also stand in a list - `exception_manager.exceptions` in the
 * status object - including persistent ones that survived a restart and were
 * never printed to the console this session. read_active_exceptions() reads
 * that list entry by entry.
