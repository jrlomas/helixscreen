/**
 * @brief Connect-time cleanup of a stranded AUTO_FEEDING_BATCH interlock
 *
 * A session that dies mid-batch leaves the macro's `doing` save-variable set,
 * and PRINT_PRESTART_CHECK refuses every print over it. Sends ACTION=END when
 * the discovery snapshot shows `doing` true with no print in flight; a
 * printing or paused print, or an active virtual_sdcard, owns the interlock
 * legitimately, because ACTION=END restores the hotend targets the batch
 * snapshotted at START - the right cleanup when idle, the wrong targets
 * mid-print. Runs on the WebSocket thread beside auto_screws' reconcile;
 * touches no LVGL.
 *
 * @param macro_object  The macro's status object key as written in
 *        printer.cfg ("gcode_macro <name>"). Klipper preserves the config's
 *        case in object keys, so the caller supplies the discovered spelling
 *        (PrinterDiscovery::macro_config_name()) rather than a guessed one.
 * @param local_batch_active  Whether THIS process has a batch it dispatched
 *        and has not seen complete (AmsBackend::filament_batch_in_flight()).
 *        True means the interlock belongs to a live batch of ours and is
 *        left alone. False after a process restart mid-batch, where the
 *        reconcile clears an interlock the still-running batch owns —
 *        accepted, since the restart already orphaned the plan that tracked
 *        it, and refusing would strand the interlock forever.
