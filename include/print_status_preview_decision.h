 * and the desired state (the current print's effective filename, view mode,
 * lifecycle intent) and this function reconciles the two. Because the decision
 * is driven by real widget state rather than intent bools, re-entry is

 *                          viewer ("" = none/blank). Tracked separately from the

 *                          thumbnail's, or a stale render is left on screen.
 * @param desired_file      The current print's effective filename
 *                          ("" = nothing to show).

 *                          source.
 * @param gcode_has_content Does the gcode viewer currently hold geometry.

 *                          print state (independent of the render-mode setting).
 * @param viewer_enabled    The render-mode setting permits the viewer at all.
 *                          False is Thumbnail Only, where the G-code is never
 *                          fetched, indexed or rendered. Gates ONLY load_gcode:
