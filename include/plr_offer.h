///     backend.
///   - Qidi (passive): discovery saw the RESUME_INTERRUPTED macro AND
///     `save_variables.variables.was_interrupted` is a JSON boolean true. The
///     stock macros leave it true during every normal print too, so
///     `printer_idle` is what scopes the offer to a boot after power loss.
