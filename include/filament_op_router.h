 * lifetime.
 *
 * That lifetime is load-bearing and easy to miss. MacroParamModal stores its
 * on_execute_ callback and does NOT clear it on dismiss — only the next
 * show_for_*() overwrites it. So a callback handed to this modal can fire
 * arbitrarily later, long after the object that built it is gone. FilamentPanel
 * is an immortal singleton and may capture [this] directly [L012]. Every other
 * caller MUST route through an AsyncLifetimeGuard token; AmsOperationSidebar is
 * destroyed whenever the AMS panel closes, which is a live use-after-free
 * without one.
