/**
 * @file firmware_fault_codes.h
 * @brief Firmwares that report faults as structured codes rather than prose.
 *
 * Some firmware raises faults with a numeric identity and embeds it in the
 * error text. Matching the sentence instead is brittle: the wording belongs to
 * the firmware, it changes between releases, and it is not translated.
 *
 * This is the one module that knows which firmwares do that and how to read
 * their codes. `GcodeErrorRouter` asks the question and never names a firmware.
 * Adding another is a row in the provider table.
