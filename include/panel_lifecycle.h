/**
 * @file panel_lifecycle.h
 * @brief Common lifecycle interface for panels and overlays
 *
 * Defines the minimal interface that both PanelBase and OverlayBase
 * implement for NavigationManager to dispatch lifecycle events.
 *
 * ## Implemented by:
 * - PanelBase: Main UI panels (enum-indexed, setup() pattern)
 * - OverlayBase: Modal overlays (widget-indexed, create() pattern)
 *
 * ## Lifecycle Contract:
 * - on_deactivate(reason) called BEFORE a panel/overlay becomes hidden
 * - on_activate() called AFTER animation completes and panel/overlay is visible
 * - get_name() used for debugging/logging only
 *
 * ## Async Lifetime Contract:
 * ViewLifecycleBase (below) owns the two AsyncLifetimeGuards every panel and
 * overlay gets, and owns the deactivation sequence. Subclasses override
 * on_deactivating(DeactivateReason), which the base calls before it invalidates
 * the screen-scoped guard — there is no base call to forget.
 *
 * @threading Main thread only

 *
 * Owns both lifetime guards and the deactivation sequence, so the two bases
 * agree on what deactivation costs a subclass's in-flight work.
 *
 * ## Which guard
 *
 * Every view gets two, and the choice is about what the callback is *for*:
 *
 * - `lifetime_` — the screen. The result only matters while the user is
 *   looking at this view: a fetch that populates visible widgets, a debounced
 *   repaint, an animation step. Dropped on every deactivation; on_activate()
 *   re-arms whatever still matters.
 * - `object_lifetime_` — the object. The view owes the completion to the
 *   machine rather than to the screen: an abort the printer must acknowledge,
 *   a settings write, a power-off handshake. It survives navigation and dies
 *   with the view, so its callbacks must be safe to run off screen — they may
 *   touch members, but must not assume any widget is visible.
 *
 * Reaching for `object_lifetime_` to stop a callback from being cancelled is
 * the wrong reason; reach for it when the work is genuinely not the screen's.
 *
 * ## Deactivation sequence
 *
 * on_deactivate() is final. It calls on_deactivating(reason) — the subclass's
 * one chance to act while its in-flight work is still live — and only then
 * invalidates `lifetime_`. A subclass that wants to schedule work from inside
 * the hook must park it on `object_lifetime_`, or the invalidation that
 * follows will drop it.
