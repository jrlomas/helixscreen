 * @brief Resolve a released drag.
 *
 * - It creates a page when cross_page_drop_creates_page() holds for the scope
 *   the release lands in. On the next-page slot the entry lands at the previewed
 *   cell; from the last page's border, in the rightmost columns its span allows,
 *   on the previewed row; from the first page's left border, in the leftmost
 *   columns on the previewed row, on a page that lands before the first.
 *   A landing cell that does not fit an empty page creates nothing.
 * - Otherwise, on a config page, it moves the entry to the previewed cell when
 *   that cell or the page differs from the origin and the span fits
 *   @p occupancy there.
 * - Anything else commits nothing: off the origin page the drag returns to it,
 *   on the origin page it snaps back.
 *
 * @param in The release.
 * @param occupancy The scoped page's widgets, the dragged one left out, on the
 *        grid the page is laid out on. Its dimensions also bound a created
 *        page's landing cell.
