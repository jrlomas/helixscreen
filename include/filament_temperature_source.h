/**
 * @file filament_temperature_source.h
 * @brief Which firmwares publish their own per-filament temperatures, and how
 *        to read them.
 *
 * Every printer has the internal filament DB's generic material table. Some
 * firmwares additionally carry their own per-vendor, per-sub-type temperature
 * table in firmware and publish it on request as one console response line —
 * a Python dict literal, not JSON, prefixed "// " on the response channel.
 * Those temperatures describe the LOAD, UNLOAD and CLEAN-NOZZLE operations,
 * not the printable range: PLA loads at 250°C against a print range nowhere
 * near it, so they are carried as their own fields and never folded into a
 * material's nozzle_min/nozzle_max.
 *
 * This is the one module that knows which firmwares publish the table and the
 * exact shape of the response. Generic code (the active-material resolver, the
 * discovery sequence) asks the questions below and never names a firmware.
 * Adding another one is a row in the provider table in
 * filament_temperature_source.cpp.
