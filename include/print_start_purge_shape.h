 * @file print_start_purge_shape.h
 * @brief Recognises a stationary purge (blob/poop or waste chute) from motion
 *
 * A stationary purge extrudes continuously with the head held at one XY: Z
 * climbs for a blob purge and stays put over a chute. The shapes around it
 * differ: a purge line moves XY, probing moves Z without extruding, and a
 * filament load or tool change pulses and retracts the extruder. Every test
 * here is relative to the motion's own earlier samples, never to a location,
 * height or speed, because purge spots and travel heights differ per printer.
 *
 * Pure: no LVGL, no threads.
