/**
 * @file pre_print_preferences.h
 * @brief Which firmwares store pre-print option settings, and how to read them.
 *
 * Most printers treat a pre-print toggle as a property of one job: the value
 * shapes that print and is forgotten. Some firmwares instead keep the setting
 * themselves, across prints and reboots, and the gcode the slicer emits is
 * gated on what they hold. On those, a row rendered from a static database
 * default would claim a state the machine does not have, and would disagree
 * with every other client looking at the same printer.
 *
 * This is the one module that knows which firmwares those are and where each
 * keeps its values. Generic code asks the capability questions below and never
 * names a firmware. Adding another one is a row in the provider table.
