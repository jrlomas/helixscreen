#   scripts/test-host-run.sh test '[netd]'               # plain suite, one tag
#   scripts/test-host-run.sh sweep                       # make unit-sweep, sharded
#   scripts/test-host-run.sh asan-app help-qr --repeat 50  # the APP under ASAN
#   scripts/test-host-run.sh tsan-app help-qr --repeat 50  # the APP under TSan
#
# The app modes are here for the same reason asan is: the run is long and
# non-interactive, and the container's image (SDL, no ld.so.preload) is the
# only place an instrumented desktop app runs cleanly.
#
# A whole-suite C++ verdict comes from sweep, which shards the way CI and the
# local gate do. test with no tag runs the suite in one process, where
# cross-test contamination fails cases no branch touched, so it is not a gate.
# bats is not run here: the container is root with no shellcheck, so the shell
# suite fails on its environment; run `make test-shell` locally instead.
#
# Why these two in particular:
#
#   mutate  mutate_diff.py rebuilds and re-runs the suite once per changed hunk,
#           so it is the most expensive and least interactive thing in the loop.
#
#   asan    a desktop whose /etc/ld.so.preload holds a library (libinput-config,
#           say) loads ASAN's runtime second, so the binary produces NO test
#           output and exits 0 - a pass that ran nothing. The container has no
#           /etc/ld.so.preload, so ASAN works there with no workaround, and its
#           image matches CI's, which is why sanitizer findings reproduce.
#
# What runs is the working tree as it is on disk: uncommitted edits and
# untracked files included, ignored files excluded. It is copied to a mirror on
# the test host, one per tree (<HELIX_TEST_TREES>/<tree> in the container),
# whose build/ persists between runs, so a run rebuilds only what changed. Each
# mirror has its own lock: two trees run at once, two runs of one tree queue.
# Every run prints and logs the HEAD it started from and whether the tree was
# dirty, with a hash of the difference, since a dirty verdict is not one anybody
# else can reproduce.
#
#   scripts/test-host-run.sh --commit sweep    # the pushed HEAD, in the shared checkout
#   scripts/test-host-run.sh --prune [DAYS]    # remove mirrors unused for DAYS (14)
#   scripts/test-host-run.sh --drop TREE       # remove one tree's mirror
#   scripts/test-host-run.sh --probe           # exit 0 when offloading to the test host pays
#
# --commit runs a pushed commit in the shared checkout (HELIX_TEST_WORKDIR)
# instead, for a verdict someone else must be able to reproduce. mutate always
# does: mutate_diff.py reads git history, and a mirror is files only.
#
# The patched submodules are mirrored as they are on disk, patches applied,
# not pristine: `make reapply-patches` resets them with git, which a mirror
# has none of, and the build's marker check confirms each patch's effect by
# text search, which works on a plain file tree.
#
# Configuration comes from the build-hosts file (scripts/lib/build_hosts.sh),
# environment first. HELIX_TEST_HOST has no default: unset, every command
# refuses and names the file to put it in.
