# (scripts/lib/build_hosts.sh) and does every step over ssh, so the host needs
# no clone of the repo.

#   scripts/test-host-setup.sh --commit-checkout  # also clone HELIX_TEST_WORKDIR for --commit runs
#
# Safe to re-run. The image is built from this tree's docker/Dockerfile.sanitizer
# every time, so there is one definition of the toolchain; the container is
# created only when it is missing (or with --recreate).
#
# The container mounts one host directory at one container directory: the
# parents of HELIX_TEST_TREES_HOST and HELIX_TEST_TREES. Mirrors, the ccache and
# the --commit checkout all live under it, so the container holds nothing worth
# keeping and recreating it loses nothing.
