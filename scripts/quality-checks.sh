#
# Two sections write to the tree; one of them only under --auto-fix:
#   qc_phase2     clang-format -i + git add   (checks only, without --auto-fix)
#   qc_xml_linter make regen-xml-schema       (always regenerates schema.json)
# Those run alone, first - a formatter rewriting a file while another check
# greps it is a race. Everything else fans out over $QC_JOBS workers.
#
# Output is buffered per section and replayed in declaration order, so the
# transcript matches the serial one apart from timings.
# Result stamp - full runs only.
#
# Path gating already handles "nothing relevant changed" for pre-commit. What is
# left is redoing an identical full sweep: pre-push straight after a manual run,
# or re-pushing with nothing touched in between. The stamp is the whole working
# state (HEAD, staged diff, unstaged diff, untracked listing), so any edit
# invalidates it. Set QC_NO_CACHE=1 to force, and note it only ever short-circuits
# a run that previously PASSED - failures are never cached.
