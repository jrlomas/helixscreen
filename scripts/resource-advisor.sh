# PreToolUse hook on Bash (wired in .claude/settings.json). Suggests where a
# heavy command should run; it never blocks and never decides permission. The
# answer is a context block the model reads before the command runs, or nothing.
#
# thelio is shared by several sessions at once; the test host (HELIX_TEST_HOST,
# driven by scripts/test-host-run.sh) is a bigger box that is usually idle.
# Mutation, sanitizers and symbolizers belong on the test host however quiet
# thelio looks, and so does a sweep: `make unit-sweep` and the C++ half of
# `make full-test-run` map to test-host-run.sh's sweep mode; bats stays on thelio,
# because the test container runs as root with no shellcheck. Container builds
# and test loops are only worth moving when thelio is tight. "Tight" is not
# decided here: `helix-claim jobs -v` reports MemAvailable, plus the jobpool's
# free tokens when one is live, and this applies one threshold to each. With no
# pool the -j is cores capped by memory, so memory is the whole signal. An
# explicit -j above that -j is worth a word only with no pool: with one, the
# make shim strips the -j and the pool decides.
#
# A command is judged segment by segment (split on && || ; | and newlines), by
# each segment's own first word, with quoted text masked. So a commit message,
# a grep pattern or a heredoc that merely mentions `make full-test-run` is
# silent.
#
# A runner that sizes itself to the machine (bats -j, GNU parallel, ninja,
# idf.py, a raw `docker run` of a build) started outside `helix-claim hold` or
# pool-docker.sh is outside the jobpool's budget; with a live pool that is
# always worth a word, tight or not.
#
# `helix-claim jobs` is make's -j: with a pool live it is the whole pool. A
# non-make runner sized from it (docker --cpus, ninja -j, parallel -j, xargs -P,
# idf.py, bats --jobs) runs that many jobs on top of every build, so that is
# always named, with or without a pool.
#
# Runs on EVERY Bash call: a command matching no heavy word returns before
# touching jq, /proc or helix-claim. Never ssh from here.
#
# Env:
#   HELIX_ADVISOR_HOSTS       hosts the advice is about (default: thelio); elsewhere it is silent
#   HELIX_ADVISOR_JOBS_CMD    command printing the `jobs -v` line (default: helix-claim jobs);
#                             tests stub the pool here, so they never read the real one
#   HELIX_ADVISOR_MIN_FREE    free pool tokens at or below which thelio is tight (default 8)
#   HELIX_ADVISOR_MIN_GB      availGB below which thelio is tight (default 16)
#   HELIX_ADVISOR_TEST_HOST_RUN    test-host-run.sh whose modes are offered (default: beside this script)
