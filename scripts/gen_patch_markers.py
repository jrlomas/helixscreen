"""Derive the patch marker table (mk/patch-markers.tsv) from wired patches.

A marker is one line a patch introduces (or removes) that upstream never
contained. Checking it is a plain text search, so it stays answerable where
git is not - a docker build rsynced from a worktree has no readable submodule
repository, but it still has the files, and "is this line in the file" does
not need anything else.

Derivation rules:
  - candidates are the patch's added lines, newest first (a regenerated patch
    appends hunks, so the last line is the one an older revision lacks), then
    its removed lines, newest first;
  - an added line qualifies when the patched checkout contains it and the
    pinned upstream HEAD does not (a line upstream also has can never prove
    the patch is present);
  - a removed line qualifies when upstream contains it and the patched
    checkout does not;
  - a candidate claimed by more than one patch is dropped - it could not be
    attributed, and a check that another patch can satisfy is worse than no
    check (it reads as coverage and verifies nothing);
  - lines shorter than 12 characters or containing tabs are not distinctive
    enough to be a marker.

The script refuses rather than emitting a partial table: a patch with no
eligible marker must gain one (or the rule must change) - never a silent gap.

Requires a git-readable tree: upstream content is read from the submodule's
pinned HEAD. The runtime check (scripts/check_patch_markers.py) deliberately
requires nothing but the files themselves.
