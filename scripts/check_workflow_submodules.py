"""Fail when a workflow job runs a submodule-dependent target without checking out submodules.

The shell suite reads files out of the submodules. Most of those tests skip
themselves when a submodule is absent, but `tests/shell/test_lvgl_event_code_gate.bats`
copies `lib/lvgl/src/misc/lv_event.h` in `setup()`, so a bare checkout kills the
whole file instead of skipping it.

That is not hypothetical: `build.yml` was fixed for it in 83b0b9d51 and
`release.yml` was left behind, so the v0.99.117 tag failed `validate-shell` and
skipped every build, publish and deploy job behind it. Nothing was released and
the tag had to be moved.

The enum has to be PATCHED as well, not merely present: `lvgl_display_sync_cb.patch`
inserts four values and renumbers everything after them, so the committed worker
table only matches a patched checkout. Both steps are therefore required.

Every `make apply-patches` command, in any job, must run with
HELIX_PATCHES_FROM_CLEAN=1. A CI runner is always a fresh clone: nothing is
applied when the recipe starts, so every patch must take its apply branch, and a
patch that can neither apply nor reverse is dead, not shadowed. Without the flag
that case only warns and the job builds on with the patch silently missing.

The flag counts in either of two forms: on the make invocation itself, or as
`env: HELIX_PATCHES_FROM_CLEAN: "1"` at the workflow or job level. The env form
is the one a workflow should use, because the apply that matters usually runs
inside a plain `make -j` build step rather than a dedicated apply step - and a
flag pinned to one step never reaches that one.

A `docker run ... make ...` step is covered by neither form: workflow env stops
at the container boundary, so the docker command itself has to forward the flag
with `-e HELIX_PATCHES_FROM_CLEAN`. Forwarded without a value, `-e` takes it
from the runner's environment, so the workflow, job or step env must still set
it - otherwise the container receives an unset variable and the apply inside
runs in its warn mode.

Deliberately not solved by making the bats file skip on a missing header: that
would turn "the committed table is up to date" green-by-skip, which is the
failure this gate exists to prevent.
