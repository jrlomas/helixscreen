"""Drift gate for the ESP32 firmware app source manifest.

The firmware is a deliberately curated subset of `src/` — the "v1 Core+AMS cut"
(see firmware/helixscreen-esp32/components/helixapp/CMakeLists.txt). Whole
subsystems are gated off (camera, label printer, gcode/bed-mesh 3D, plugins,
timelapse viewer, screensaver, calibration panels, sound, mocks, the concrete
libhv client). The manifest (`app_srcs.txt`) is hand-maintained: it was
generated once from the native-audit 491-file Xtensa-compile classification and
has drifted twice since (ams_endless_spool.cpp, toolhead_homing.cpp — each
landed in main without making the manifest, and the firmware link broke ~25 min
into esp32-build CI).

Curation is unavoidable for a subset build. The fix is not to auto-glob all of
src/ (that pulls hundreds of Xtensa-incompatible files) but to make the drift
LOUD at quality-check / PR time instead of at a 25-minute link step.

WHAT IS FLAGGED
  - A `src/**/*.{cpp,c}` in NEITHER app_srcs.txt NOR app_srcs_excluded.txt
    ("undecided" — a new file, or one nobody decided on). Add it to app_srcs.txt
    (compile it on the firmware) or to the exclusion file (don't).
  - A manifest line CMake would silently DROP or mangle (see MANIFEST LINE
    FORMAT below) — the failure mode this gate exists to prevent, since the
    line looks present to a reader and is absent to the build.
  - A `src/...` line in app_srcs.txt whose file no longer exists ("stale" — the
    source was deleted/renamed but the manifest line wasn't).
  - A `src/...` entry in app_srcs_excluded.txt whose file no longer exists, or
    a `dir/` entry with no src/ files left beneath it. A rotted exclusion is
    worse than a rotted manifest line: rename a file onto a stale excluded path
    and the new file is silently auto-excluded from the firmware.
  - A file in BOTH manifest and exclusions (directly, or via a `dir/` entry).
    CMake compiles it; the exclusion file says it doesn't. One of them is a lie.

NOT FLAGGED
  - Manifest entries OUTSIDE src/ (e.g. lib/lv_markdown/*.c). The universe is
    src/ only; the manifest legitimately pulls a few lib/ sources.
  - Anything not under src/.

MANIFEST LINE FORMAT (app_srcs.txt) — dictated by CMake, not by this script
  CMakeLists.txt reads the manifest with
      file(STRINGS app_srcs.txt APP_SRCS_REL REGEX "^[^#].*\\.(cpp|c)$")
  so a line only reaches the build when it starts with a non-`#` character AND
  ends in `.cpp`/`.c`. Consequences, all of them silent at CMake time:
    - `src/a/b.cpp  # keep, AMS needs it` does NOT end in .cpp → DROPPED.
    - `src/a/b.cpp   ` (trailing space)   does NOT end in .cpp → DROPPED.
    - `  src/a/b.cpp` (leading space) matches, and CMake then builds the path
      `<repo>/ src/a/b.cpp` → a bogus source path.
  So: one bare path per line, nothing after it. Comment lines start with `#`
  (the manifest carries its whole derivation ledger that way). This gate
  rejects any other shape — it fails CLOSED, because the alternative is a
  25-minute CI link error for a line that reads as correct.

EXCLUSION FILE FORMAT (app_srcs_excluded.txt)
  Only this script reads it, so it is the permissive one:
  - One path per line; `#`-prefixed lines and trailing `# reason` are ignored.
  - A path ending in `/` excludes a whole directory recursively.
  - Any other path excludes that single file.

MODES
  (default)          check; exit 0 if clean, 1 on any finding above.
  --list             print the undecided files, one per line.
  --summary          one-line counts.
  --link             link-level check over the native build's objects (build/obj):
                     fails when a listed file references a symbol that only an
                     excluded file defines, which the source checks cannot see.
                     A symbol the firmware's own sources stub, or a reference whose
                     every mention sits in a branch the firmware does not compile,
                     is fine. Known references are ratcheted in --baseline
                     (default scripts/esp32_link_baseline.txt).
                     Exit 2 when listed objects are missing (no native build yet).
  --write-exclusions SEEDING/BULK-ADD tool, not the answer to routine drift.
                     Adds the currently-undecided files to the baseline,
                     compressing whole directories to dir-level entries.
                     Refuses to touch an existing baseline without --force;
                     with --force it MERGES (existing entries and their
                     hand-written reasons are preserved). Delete the file
                     first if you really want a clean re-seed.

Exit 0 when the manifest and exclusion baseline cover src/ exactly, 1 otherwise.
