# The 89 [.]-tagged tests are excluded from `make full-test-run`: they need ui_xml/

# without anyone noticing. See docs/devel/HIDDEN_TESTS_TRACKER.md.

# Kept off the hot path the same two ways the helix-xml block above is:
#   - Triggers only on staged code. A docs/installer/asset commit skips.
#   - NEVER builds. A cold test build is ten minutes, which must not land on a
#     commit hook, so this runs only when the test binary is already current
#     (`make -q`) — i.e. the author has built tests anyway and the marginal
#     cost is the ~65s run itself. Stale or absent binary skips with an
#     instruction. That also means CI mode skips: the Code Quality runner
#     never builds the binary. The hidden set belongs in nightly there.
# When it does run, a failure blocks like any other test gate.
