# A user-facing string that never reached translations/*.yml fails silently at
# runtime: lv_translation_get() falls back to the tag, so the string renders in
# English in all nine languages and only a debug-level line says so. One bundle
# carried 1445 of those lines. v0.99.116 was tagged with five such strings on
# main because this gate lived only in tests/shell/test_code_lint.bats, which a
# release runs after quality-checks and which nothing runs pre-commit.
#
# The dry run proves a KEY exists, nothing more: `make translation-sync` writes
# a brand-new key as an EMPTY placeholder, and an empty value renders as empty
# text in that locale (lv_translation_get() only falls back on a MISSING key).
# So the second half runs the same pytests CI's Code Quality job runs,
# tests/python/test_cpp_translation_coverage.py and test_explicit_tag_coverage.py
# (XML label_tag/description_tag keys), which fail on empty values - reusing
# those scans rather than restating the rule here.
#
# --dry-run is load-bearing: a bare `sync` REWRITES all nine catalogs, and a
# check that edits the tree it is inspecting would stage catalog churn behind
# the committer's back.
