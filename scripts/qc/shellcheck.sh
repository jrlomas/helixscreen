# Two trees, held to two different bars.
#
#   config/  - platform hooks and the init script. Clean at shellcheck's
#              default severity; kept there.
#   scripts/ - installer modules, launcher, release tooling. These ship to
#              devices and are held to the same bar as config/: clean at
#              warning severity (minus the two excluded codes below). The 19
#              files that carried pre-existing findings when this gate landed
#              have since been fixed and SHELLCHECK_BASELINE is empty. A file
#              enters the baseline only by explicit decision after a fix is
#              judged riskier than the finding; the list may shrink, never
#              grow. Variables shared across `source` boundaries carry a
#              per-line disable directive naming their consumer at the
#              assignment site - SC1091 is excluded, so shellcheck cannot see
#              those reads itself.
#
# Two codes are excluded for scripts/:
#   SC3043 - "local is undefined in POSIX sh". Deliberate - the installer and
#            launcher target BusyBox ash, which does implement local.
#   SC1091 - "not following sourced file". The installer sources its modules
#            by a path that only exists once unpacked on the device.
