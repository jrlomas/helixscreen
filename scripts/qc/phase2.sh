# The pinned wheel (qc_resolve_clang_format) is the only formatter this tree
# accepts, on every machine and in CI, so its verdict is byte-identical
# everywhere and a difference is a real one. A distro or Homebrew
# clang-format, even another 18.x, reflows differently, and two formatters
# taking turns on one file is how files ping-pong between commits; a tree
# that cannot resolve the pin fails here instead of formatting with whatever
# it has.
#
# Files that were unformatted when this gate started blocking are carried in
# CLANG_FORMAT_BASELINE: still-unformatted entries are reported, not failed,
# until they are next staged - the pre-commit auto-format cleans them then
# - and a full sweep refuses an entry that has come clean, so the list only
# shrinks.
