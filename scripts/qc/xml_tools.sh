# XML Validator Tool Build

# qc_xml_attr passes vacuously when its binary is missing, and nothing in a
# normal build produces it — `make` builds only the app. This step builds it
# ahead of that gate, serially and before the parallel batch, so two gates
# never run make against one tree at once. Failing to build is a red gate, not
# a skip: a validator that silently doesn't exist is a validator that silently
# passes.
#
# validate-xml-constants is not built here: it links the whole app, which on
# a cold CI runner is a full build that cannot finish inside the step's time
# limit. Its check runs in the unit suite instead (see qc_xml_const).
