# pool-docker.sh: run a container build inside the machine's jobpool budget.
#
#     scripts/pool-docker.sh docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE make [ARGS...]
#     scripts/pool-docker.sh docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE CMD [ARGS...]
#
# Any client with docker's `run` syntax works in place of docker.
#
# A make in the container joins the pool itself: the pool's state dir is
# mounted, the container opens the FIFO and exports MAKEFLAGS (`jobpool
# docker-args` / `container-env`), and the make's own -j is dropped, since a
# -j makes make leave a jobserver. If the container cannot open the FIFO
# (a remapped uid, a VM that cannot share a FIFO) that make keeps its -j.
#
# An idf.py or ninja command joins too, through ninja 1.13's jobserver client,
# so its jobs grow and shrink with the pool for the whole build: the state dir
# is mounted, scripts/ninja-jobserver.sh's ninja (fetched once, then cached) is
# mounted over the image's /usr/bin/ninja, MAKEFLAGS names the FIFO, and
# IDF_PY_BUILD_JOBS is emptied, since idf.py passes it as -j and any -j turns
# ninja's jobserver off. The container's root, or the -u uid, must be able to
# open the FIFO; one that cannot leaves ninja at its own default parallelism.
#
# Any other command (a build script), or idf.py when no ninja 1.13 can be had,
# cannot join, so it runs under `helix-claim hold`, which holds tokens for the
# container's life and passes their count in as JOBPOOL_SLOTS and
# IDF_PY_BUILD_JOBS (idf.py's ninja -j).
#
# Without jobpool (CI, a Mac, a fresh clone), with JOBPOOL=0, or when the pool
# will not start, the command runs exactly as given.
