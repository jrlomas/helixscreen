# Apply one patch to one vendored submodule with a verdict that cannot lie.
#
# A bare `git apply --check` cannot distinguish "already applied" from "this
# patch no longer matches the submodule": both exit non-zero, so an else-branch
# that prints "already applied" turns a dead patch into a green line. A reverse
# check does not settle it either — several patches share one file (seven touch
# src/misc/lv_event.c), and once a sibling patch has moved the context, a
# correctly applied patch neither forward- nor reverse-applies.
#
# So the verdict is three-way, and the hard failure belongs to the only run
# that can judge: a from-clean apply (HELIX_PATCHES_FROM_CLEAN=1, set by `make
# reapply-patches`). From clean nothing is applied yet, so every patch must
# take the apply branch; anything else means the patch does not match the
# submodule. Incremental runs warn instead, because there a sibling patch
# earlier in the same recipe may legitimately have moved the context.
#
# The flag is a claim about the tree, and the claim is verified, not assumed:
# `make clean` deletes the stamp but leaves the submodules patched, and on a
# patched tree shared-file shadowing makes healthy patches read "neither", so
# an unverified flag would fail a perfectly good checkout. A mk/patches.mk run
# settles the claim once at recipe start into HELIX_FROM_CLEAN_SENTINEL; a
# standalone invocation judges the submodule directly.
#
# Usage: apply_submodule_patch.sh <submodule-dir> <patch-file> <label> [note]
#
# The optional note names the runtime consequence of building without the
# patch. It is appended to the verdicts that mean "this patch may be
# missing" - the marker-absent warn and the from-clean fatal - never to the
# success lines.
#
# The neither-branch is triaged by the marker table: one line this patch
# adds (or removes) that upstream never contained, grepped by
# check_patch_markers.py --only. A present marker means the patch's effect
# is in the checkout and a sibling merely moved the context git compares,
# which is the routine case on shared files (seven patches touch
# src/misc/lv_event.c); an absent marker means the effect is genuinely
# missing; no row means no information and the verdict stays hedged.
