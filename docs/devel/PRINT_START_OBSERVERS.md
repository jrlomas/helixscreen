# Print-Start Observer System

How HelixScreen turns "the printer is preparing a print" into a truthful status
line, an ETA, and a progress bar - across firmwares that narrate everything,
firmwares that narrate nothing, and firmwares in between.

Three sibling docs own the adjacent detail:

- [PRINT_START_PROFILES.md](PRINT_START_PROFILES.md) - the JSON profile schema
  (patterns, weights, flags) and how to author one for a new printer.
- [PRINT_START_INTEGRATION.md](PRINT_START_INTEGRATION.md) - user-facing setup,
  pre-start gcode options, and the silent-phase signal descriptions.
- [PREPRINT_PREDICTION.md](PREPRINT_PREDICTION.md) - the ETA engine: phase
  timing, thermal model, weighted history buckets.

The collector is a `shared_ptr` owned by `MoonrakerManager`, recreated on every
printer switch. Every background-thread entry point holds it via `weak_ptr`
(`s_collector`) and drops out if the collector was replaced.

## Signal sources

| # | Source | Arrives on | Gate | Effect |
|---|--------|-----------|------|--------|
| 1 | `notify_gcode_response` lines | WS thread (client callback) | active + profile patterns | phase transitions, messages; `real_signal_seen_` latches and mutes proactive detection |
| 2 | `probe at X,Y is z=Z` lines (subset of #1) | WS thread | active, in/pre-mesh | mesh point counting (N/M); intercepted BEFORE pattern matching so they can never re-announce BED_MESH and reset the denominator |
| 3 | bed-mesh presence flap (`bed_mesh.probed_matrix` present→absent) | WS thread (`MoonrakerAPI` bed_mesh callback → `set_bed_mesh_presence_observer`) | active + phase==CLEANING | enters BED_MESH ("Bed Meshing...") + fetches the probe denominator; observer copied under a mutex (weakly-ordered targets read stale-null otherwise) |
| 4 | toolhead position subjects (`toolhead.position`, already subscribed) | main thread (queued status updates; 3 permanent `ObserverGuard`s) | active + profile `position_signals` | `PrintStartPositionClassifier`: centre Z-descents → "Probing Z...", ≥3-distinct-corner tour → "Checking Bed Mesh...", row march → BED_MESH entry |
| 5 | heater targets / temps / layers / progress (fallback observers) | main thread (subject observers) | active + `enable_fallbacks()` + NOT `real_signal_seen_` | proactive heating phases, adaptive timeouts, completion fallbacks |

Sources 3 and 4 exist because Creality K1-class firmware forwards nothing to
the console for ~3 minutes of Z-probing, corner validation, and mesh sweep -
while sources that ARE not console output keep flowing. They only fill silence:
a real console marker always outranks them, and their refinements are
message-only unless the sweep march promotes BED_MESH (the same edge as the
flap, so the two corroborate each other).

## Arming and windows

`should_start_print_collector()` arms on a STANDBY→PRINTING transition with
zero progress AND zero `print_duration` (joining a print mid-job must not
raise the pre-print overlay). `PrintStartCollector::note_host_side_pre_start()`
declares that the dispatch came from our own pre-start gcode block; the
prediction history then re-filters to the host-pre-start bucket so its minutes
of extra work never average into printer-edge prints (and vice versa).

## ETA path (short version - see PREPRINT_PREDICTION.md)

`compute_predicted_weights()` blends the thermal model (heater targets learned
rates) with history-bucket per-phase durations. The monotonic countdown anchor
re-baselines whenever the weights' inputs change (heater targets newly set or
risen ≥15°C) - not merely when time passes - so a provisional 0°C-targets
estimate can't freeze the display when the real one arrives a second later.
Downward moves ease (capped per tick); remaining never rises between
input changes.

## Threading and lifetime rules

- Console lines (#1/#2) and the flap (#3) fire on the WS thread; the collector
  serializes everything through `state_mutex_`. `lv_tr` at that call site is
  the documented #1219 debt family - follow the existing `note_bed_mesh_presence`
  shape if you add a sibling.
- Position and fallback observers (#4/#5) fire on the main thread via queued
  subject sets. Their guards are permanent for the manager's lifetime and
  early-out on `!active_` before locking - the same shape as the heater-target
  fallback observers.
- `MoonrakerManager::shutdown()` RELEASES (not resets) every observer guard:
  subjects may already be deinitialized at that point (#579 family). Any new
  guard must be added there.
- The bed-mesh presence observer is copied under `bed_mesh_presence_mutex_`
  before invocation - see `fix(api): guard bed-mesh presence observer against
  cross-thread staleness` for the on-device race this closes.

## Where the behavior is pinned

| Behavior | Test |
|----------|------|
| K1C mesh sweep keeps its denominator (N/25, no sub-phase wipe) | `test_print_start_collector.cpp` - K1C replay fixture |
| Flap during CLEANING enters Bed Meshing | `test_print_start_collector.cpp` - flap test |
| ETA re-baselines on heater-target arrival and staged rise | `test_print_start_collector.cpp` - `[eta]` tests |
| A heating phase completes at its target, not when the chain's marker passes (concurrent-heat firmware) | `test_print_start_collector.cpp` - "Remaining keeps unfinished heating work" |
| Timeouts wait for both heaters at target (2°C) and count a climbing heater or a status-signal rule as activity (a new high under the current target, not a swing back up); the ceiling ignores temps, heaters and rules but waits out narration; the backstop ignores everything | `test_print_start_collector.cpp` - "Timeout fallback waits for the heaters to reach their targets", "A heater still closing on its target counts as activity", "A heater cycling under its target is not climbing", "A heater sampled during the last print is not climbing on the next", "The ceiling ends a pre-print whose heater never settles", "The ceiling waits for a narrating printer to go quiet", "A printer that never stops narrating ends at the backstop", "The ceiling stretches for a long prediction", "A status-signal rule is not a line the ceiling waits out", "A status-signal rule holds the timeout like a climbing heater" |
| A pattern's declared hold (a COSMOS heat soak's silent G4) counts as the printer talking until it ends and is left out of the ceiling; its display copy holds once; the backstop leaves out at most one ceiling of held time | `test_print_start_collector.cpp` - "A declared hold counts as the printer talking until it ends", "A declared hold is left out of the time the ceiling measures", "A printer that keeps announcing holds still ends at the backstop", "a long COSMOS heat soak holds the pre-print open"; `test_print_start_profile.cpp` - "a pattern's hold comes from the capture group it names"; `test_print_start_profile_cosmos.cpp` |
| A database entry's `thermal_rates` replace the bed-size guess (unknown heater names skipped); a timeout completion saves the rates it measured but not its phase timings; homing takes the predictor's floor in both the collector and the print details estimate | `test_thermal_rate_model.cpp` - "ThermalRateManager takes measured rates from the printer database"; `test_printer_detector.cpp` - "pre-print lookups share one entry, and rates name known heaters"; `test_print_start_collector.cpp` - "A timeout completion keeps the heating rates it measured", real COSMOS replay's database-rates section; `test_preprint_predictor.cpp` - "homing estimate never drops below the floor"; `test_print_preparation_manager.cpp` - "estimate takes its homing time from the predictor" |
| A pre-print saves its whole measured climb as the heating rate, holds between climbs left out | `test_thermal_rate_model.cpp` - "ThermalRateModel leaves a hold between two climbs out of the rate it keeps", "ThermalRateModel keeps the rate of the whole climb, not its last approach"; `test_print_start_collector.cpp` - "a COSMOS pre-print learns the heating rates it took" |
| A bed mesh with no probing under way gives way to the nozzle heating toward a target set after the mesh began; a recent probe line or an unchanged target keeps the mesh | `test_print_start_collector.cpp` - "A bed mesh with no probing under way gives way to the nozzle heat after it", "a quiet COSMOS park and purge shows the nozzle heating" |
| A real COSMOS pre-print completes at its skew check, not on a timeout | `test_print_start_collector.cpp` - "real COSMOS pre-print completes at its last step" (replay of the 2026-09-14 CC1 klippy.log) |
| Entering a phase releases the monotonic anchor (no frozen countdown through a long mesh) | `test_print_start_collector.cpp` - "Entering a phase releases the monotonic countdown anchor" |
| Sweep-march promotion credits the buffered pre-mesh probes (count matches the physical taps) | `test_print_start_collector.cpp` - "Buffered pre-mesh probes are credited" |
| Position chain wipe → centre → corners → sweep on real captures | `test_print_start_position_classifier.cpp` (corpus: `tests/fixtures/print_start_position_corpus.json`, extracted from the 2026-08-19 K1C klippy.log capture) |
| Position → message/phase integration, and the no-flag negative | `test_print_start_collector.cpp` - `[position]` integration tests |
| K1C first-print ETA defaults from measured durations | `test_printer_detector.cpp` - `print_start_default_phases` |
| K2 patterns match the real narration; `BED_MESH_CLEAR` deliberately NOT a mesh pattern | `test_print_start_profile_k2.cpp` (captures: 2026-08-18 K2 Plus klippy.log) |
| A Klipper shutdown or error stops the collector even while print_stats still reports a job (the U1 reports `paused` after a verify_heater shutdown) | `test_moonraker_manager.cpp` - "should_stop_collector_on_klippy_state stops on shutdown and error" (the decision; the observer wiring in `MoonrakerManager::init_print_start_collector` is not constructible in a unit test) |
| While a heater wait reports (the once-a-second `B:.. /.. T0:.. /..` lines of M109/M190/TEMPERATURE_WAIT) after a real signal, the label shows the heater short of its target, nozzle first, then the bed, then a chamber heater once both are at target (SOAKING, "Heating chamber..."). A phase signal ends the wait; otherwise the first tick after the reports stop restores the displaced phase, message and sequential progress. Stray lines, a heater merely warming behind a phase, and firmware HEATING_* phases are left alone; reports count as activity for the timeouts | `test_print_start_collector.cpp` - `[heater_wait]` tests, including "a bed wait after plate detect shows Heating Bed until it ends", "a wait shows the nozzle while it is short, then the bed", "a long chamber wait holds the pre-print past its deadline", "A phase signal right after a wait's last report keeps its phase", "A chamber wait does not relabel a heating phase the firmware announced", "A heater wait gives a sequential profile's phase, message and progress back", and "real heater waits show the bed heating between firmware phases" (replay of `tests/fixtures/u1_heater_wait_console.txt`, the 2026-09-23 U1 gcode_store) |
| Whole chain (wiring, observers, collector) against a real capture, no printer | `HELIX_MOCK_REPLAY=<script> --test` (see MOCK_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md; script from `scripts/extract_mock_replay.py`) |
