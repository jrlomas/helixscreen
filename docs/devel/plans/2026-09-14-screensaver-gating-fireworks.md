# Screensaver Gating and Fireworks Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Every board that builds screensavers runs one at the best quality it can sustain, decided by measuring the saver's own CPU cost on that board, and a new fireworks saver proves the design at 60 fps on the Pi 3B and on 16-bit boards.

**Architecture:** One always-compiled registry names every saver; a shared foundation (overlay, canvas, frame timer, pixel writer, saver base) carries all four savers, and the three existing savers move onto it with pixel-identical output pinned by fingerprint tests. `ScreensaverManager` samples process CPU time on the display manager's idle-check tick, subtracts an idle baseline, compares 5 s windows against a per-core budget with a pure decision function, steps the running saver down its ladder, and remembers the level per saver, app version and board fingerprint in config. Fireworks is a pure simulation that draws through `PixelWriter` into RGB565 or XRGB8888 frames and returns one dirty box per rocket or burst.

**Tech Stack:** C++17 (`-std=c++17`), LVGL 9.5 (public API plus the private headers the tree already includes), helix-xml, Catch2 v3 (`tests/catch_amalgamated.hpp`), spdlog, nlohmann json via `hv/json.hpp`, GNU make, bash and POSIX sh (shellcheck), Python 3 with pytest, a static armv7 C probe built in the `helixscreen/toolchain-cc1` Docker image.

**Spec:** docs/devel/plans/2026-09-14-screensaver-gating-fireworks-design.md

## Global Constraints

- The spec is authoritative: this plan implements exactly it, adds no feature and drops none.
- Compiler standard is `-std=c++17` (Makefile `CXXFLAGS`); no C++20 (`std::span`, designated initialisers) anywhere.
- LVGL private headers are included only as `lvgl/src/<dir>/<name>_private.h`, the way `src/ui/screensaver_manager.cpp` includes `lvgl/src/misc/lv_timer_private.h`; `LV_USE_PRIVATE_API` stays 0.
- Stable saver names: `toasters`, `starfield`, `pipes`, `fireworks`. Fireworks is type 4.
- Budget, verbatim: "By core count: 4 or more cores 50%, 3 cores 37%, 2 cores 25%, 1 core 10%. Halved while a print is running."
- Window, verbatim: "After a saver starts, the first second is ignored. Then each 5 s window, for as long as the saver runs, computes `(cpu delta - baseline * wall) / wall` as a share of one core."
- Baseline, verbatim: "While no saver runs, `ScreensaverManager` samples the clock from the display manager's idle check, which runs every main-loop iteration, at most every 250 ms. The baseline is the CPU rate over the last idle stretch of up to 10 s. Under 3 s of samples, the baseline is 0, which can only make the gate step down early, never late."
- Decision, verbatim: "Over budget: step one level down at the saver's next natural break. Over budget at the bottom level: mark the board too heavy. A session is one run of a saver from start to stop; within it the level never steps up, and the next run starts at the stored level."
- Level store, verbatim: config-only setting at `/display/screensaver_levels/<name>`: `{"level": n, "too_heavy": bool, "version": "...", "board": "..."}`; `version` is `helix_version_full()`; `board` is a pure function of the running display backend (drm, egl, fbdev, sdl), CPU core count, bogomips rounded to 100, resolution and colour depth; "A mismatch in either starts again from level 0. Malformed entries are ignored."
- Too heavy, verbatim: "The session falls back to a static black `SaverOverlay` with no frame timer, logs once why, and the store remembers it until the app version or board fingerprint changes."
- Ladders, verbatim: "Level 0 runs at 16 ms (a 60 Hz panel) by default, and `HELIX_SCREENSAVER_REFR_PERIOD_MS` overrides it for manual testing; the smoothness branch ships the pacing defaults (EGL vsync, main-loop floor) that keep 16 ms even. Starfield and pipes get two levels: 16 ms, then 33 ms. Toasters get three: 16 ms with every sprite, 33 ms with every sprite, 33 ms with 10 sprites, which replaces today's tier-based sprite cap. Motion is time-based, so a period change mid-run is seamless." `SAVER_FAST_PERIOD` is 16. When `HELIX_SCREENSAVER_REFR_PERIOD_MS` is set it replaces level 0's period, for the saver's frame timer and the held display refresh alike (`SaverBase::level_period_ms(0)` returns `RefreshPeriodHold::period()`); levels 1 and up keep their declared periods. While a saver runs, the display refresh follows the saver's current period, so the two stay equal at every level.
- Device runs set the pacing that keeps 16 ms even: every Pi 3B arm puts `HELIX_EGL_VSYNC=1 HELIX_LOOP_MIN_SLEEP_MS=1` in its drop-in and checks the running app carries them (Task 0 `arm_measure.sh`, `APP_ENV ok`), and the CC1 and AD5M runs set both in `helixscreen.env` (Task 11). They are set, not detected: the app logs neither when it equals the default, and setting a default changes nothing, so the 57 fps bar stays meaningful.
- Every device step needs Preston's approval for this session, holds a `helix-claim` on the device while it touches it, and runs no load unless Moonraker reports the printer is not printing or paused. Pi 3B steps that drive the device directly run between `perf_pi3b_take` and `perf_pi3b_release`.
- Dirty areas: "invalidation of a list of dirty areas merged to at most 32".
- Fireworks ladder, verbatim (applied when the next shell launches; all tunables in one table):

  | Level | Frame period | Sparks per burst | Trail | Bursts at once |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | 0 | 16 ms | 150 | 5 | 6 |
  | 1 | 33 ms | 150 | 5 | 6 |
  | 2 | 33 ms | 90 | 3 | 4 |
  | 3 | 50 ms | 50 | 0 | 3 |

- Fireworks pacing, verbatim: "One shell every 0.8 to 2.5 s; every 3 minutes or so a finale of 6 to 10 shells over about 4 s." Sparks come "from a pool allocated at start (about 30 KB at level 0); a full pool drops new sparks rather than allocating."
- Tiers: `STANDARD_RAM_THRESHOLD_MB` drops from 2048 to 768; 4 cores stays required; lands as its own commit after a Pi 3B UI check under the load gate.
- Default: fresh installs default `screensaver_type` to flying toasters wherever savers are built; existing configs are not migrated (no config migration, `CONFIG_VERSION` untouched).
- Environment switches `HELIX_SCREENSAVER_BUDGET_PCT` and `HELIX_SCREENSAVER_LEVEL`: "parsed strictly (malformed values warn and are ignored)", documented in `docs/devel/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md`.
- Load gate, verbatim: "`cyclictest --policy=other` plus `stress-ng --cpu 2`, every run max under 20 ms and p99 under 5 ms". BusyBox boards use the wake-up probe plus busy loops with the same pass rule.
- "No print runs during measurement, and Preston approves each device before it is stressed."
- "No new threads, so no TSAN run."
- Test access, verbatim: "One generic access class through the base (overlay, canvas, timer, seed, level). Per-saver access classes remain only for simulation state the base does not own (pipes grid, stars, sprites)."
- Fingerprints, verbatim: "They are recorded for the x86-64 Linux test build and skip elsewhere, since antialiased float math can move a pixel."
- Fireworks registration includes "a CJK font rebake for the new glyphs", and Task 10 writes "a durable `docs/devel/SCREENSAVERS.md` so this spec and its plan can be deleted when the work ships".
- Source files start with `// Copyright (C) 2025-2026 356C LLC` then `// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later` in tests (as existing tests do) and `// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later` alone in `src/` and `include/` (as the existing screensaver files do); shell and Python files carry `# SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later` in their first three lines.
- spdlog only; declarations live in `helix::ui` (existing global `Screensaver`, `ScreensaverManager`, `ScreensaverType` stay global); no RTTI (`static_cast` downcasts only); comments describe the code as it is now, never its history; doc citations are `path#symbol`, never line numbers.
- Every new `src/**/*.cpp` gets a line in `firmware/helixscreen-esp32/components/helixapp/app_srcs_excluded.txt`; every new screensaver source is covered by the Makefile `ENABLE_SCREENSAVER` filter.
- Every commit body carries exactly one `Mutation:` line naming the mutation made by hand and the test that went red (or, where a hunk cannot be killed on the test host, the surviving mutation and why).
- `git commit -m` takes simple double-quoted strings; paths are named explicitly, never `git add -A` or `git add .`; no em-dash characters in code, docs or commit text.
- Builds: check `pgrep -x -d' ' 'make|cc1plus'` first, use `-j"$(scripts/helix-claim jobs)"`, run in the foreground, and never pipe a build through `head`, `tail` or `grep` (redirect to a log file and filter the file). `make test` before `./build/bin/helix-tests`, run from the repo root.
- No device address, user name or password literal in the repo: scripts read `HELIX_PERF_HOST`, `HELIX_PERF_USER`, `HELIX_PERF_PASSWORD` from the environment; the values live in the device roster memory (`reference_ssh_access.md`).

## Conventions every task uses

Set these once per shell (the scratch directory is your session scratchpad, outside the repo):

```bash
cd <worktree root>                      # the worktree Step 0 creates; commands run from its root
export SS_SCRATCH=<your scratchpad>/screensaver-gating
mkdir -p "$SS_SCRATCH"
JOBS=$(scripts/helix-claim jobs)
```

- Compile check for touched sources: `scripts/syntax_check.py <files>`.
- Build the tests: `pgrep -x -d' ' 'make|cc1plus'; make test -j"$JOBS" > "$SS_SCRATCH/test-build.log" 2>&1; echo "exit $?"`. On a non-zero exit read the log with `grep -n -E 'error|Error' "$SS_SCRATCH/test-build.log"`.
- Run a tag: `./build/bin/helix-tests "[tag]"`.
- Build the app: `make -j"$JOBS" > "$SS_SCRATCH/app-build.log" 2>&1; echo "exit $?"`.
- Format before committing: `.venv/bin/clang-format -i <changed C++ files>` (the pre-commit hook checks it too).
- Commit: stage the named paths with `git add -- <paths>`, then `git commit -m "<subject>" -m "<body paragraph>" -m "Mutation: <mutation and the test that went red>"`. The pre-commit hook runs `scripts/quality-checks.sh`, which builds; wait for it in the foreground.
- A mutation step means: make the named edit by hand, rebuild the tests, run the tag, confirm the named test fails, then undo the edit exactly and rebuild.

### Step 0: A clean worktree on the landed smoothness base

Every task runs in one new worktree cut from `origin/main` once the smoothness work is on it, holding nothing HEAD does not describe: no uncommitted or untracked file, and no lvgl change beyond the patch set `mk/patches.mk` applies at HEAD. A stray experiment in either (an `LV_INV_BUF_SIZE` edit, a draft doc) would otherwise be committed with Task 0 or measured as if it were this branch.

From the main tree, with `SS_SCRATCH` and `JOBS` set as in the block above:

```bash
git fetch origin
git merge-base --is-ancestor feature/screensaver-smoothness origin/main; echo "smoothness on main: exit $?"
scripts/setup-worktree.sh --base origin/main --no-build feature/screensaver-gating
cd .worktrees/screensaver-gating
git log -1 --format='%h %s'
ls docs/devel/plans/2026-09-14-screensaver-gating-fireworks-design.md docs/devel/plans/2026-09-14-screensaver-gating-fireworks.md
```

Expected: `smoothness on main: exit 0`; HEAD is the tip of `origin/main`; both plan documents are listed (Task 11 deletes them in the shipping change, so they must be committed). If the smoothness branch landed as a squash, `--is-ancestor` exits `1` although the work is on main: ask Preston for the landing commit and run `git merge-base --is-ancestor <that commit> origin/main` instead. Any other failure: stop and tell Preston.

Then prove the tree is what HEAD describes:

```bash
git status --porcelain | wc -l
make reapply-patches > "$SS_SCRATCH/reapply-patches.log" 2>&1; echo "reapply exit $?"
python3 scripts/check_patch_drift.py; echo "drift exit $?"
git -C lib/lvgl status --porcelain --untracked-files=no | awk '{print $2}' | sort > "$SS_SCRATCH/lvgl-modified.txt"
make -pn 2>/dev/null | sed -n 's/^LVGL_PATCHED_FILES := //p' | tr ' ' '\n' | sed '/^$/d' | sort -u > "$SS_SCRATCH/lvgl-patched.txt"
wc -l < "$SS_SCRATCH/lvgl-patched.txt"
comm -23 "$SS_SCRATCH/lvgl-modified.txt" "$SS_SCRATCH/lvgl-patched.txt"
grep -n 'define LV_INV_BUF_SIZE' lib/lvgl/src/display/lv_display_private.h
git status --porcelain | wc -l
```

Expected:
- `0` from both `git status` counts. `.gitmodules` marks `lib/lvgl` `ignore = dirty`, so applied patches do not show; anything listed is a file HEAD does not have.
- `reapply exit 0`: `make reapply-patches` puts lvgl's patched files back to upstream and applies exactly the set `mk/patches.mk` names at HEAD, so no earlier experiment survives in them.
- `drift exit 0`: every applied patch matches its file in `patches/`.
- A non-zero patched-file count, and `comm` printing nothing: no lvgl file is changed outside that patch set.
- A line defining `LV_INV_BUF_SIZE` as `32`, the invalidation-area limit `SAVER_MAX_DIRTY_AREAS` (Task 3) matches.

Anything else: stop and show Preston the output before building. Then build once, `make -j"$JOBS" > "$SS_SCRATCH/app-build.log" 2>&1; echo "exit $?"` (expect `exit 0`), and use this directory as `<worktree root>` from here on.

### Task 0: Measurement harness in the repo

Ports the Pi 3B measurement scripts out of a session scratchpad into `scripts/screensaver-perf/`, with every device setting from the environment, adds the BusyBox wake-up probe and its gate, and pins the parsers with pytest.

**Files:**
- Create: `scripts/screensaver-perf/perf_env.sh`, `scripts/screensaver-perf/pi3b_service.sh`, `scripts/screensaver-perf/pi3b_deploy.sh`, `scripts/screensaver-perf/pi3b_measure.sh`, `scripts/screensaver-perf/pi3b_loadgate.sh`, `scripts/screensaver-perf/pi3b_pass.sh`, `scripts/screensaver-perf/pi3b_gate.sh`, `scripts/screensaver-perf/arm_measure.sh`, `scripts/screensaver-perf/embedded_loadgate.sh`, `scripts/screensaver-perf/embedded_gate.sh`, `scripts/screensaver-perf/wakeup_probe.c`, `scripts/screensaver-perf/flips.py`, `scripts/screensaver-perf/ctparse.py`, `scripts/screensaver-perf/summarize.py`, `scripts/screensaver-perf/README.md`
- Modify: `scripts/CLAUDE.md` (new subsection after the `### Release & Packaging` table)
- Test: `tests/python/test_screensaver_perf_parsers.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing.
- Produces (used by Tasks 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11):
  - Environment: `HELIX_PERF_HOST`, `HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH` (required), `HELIX_PERF_USER` (default `pi`), `HELIX_PERF_PASSWORD` (unset = key auth), `HELIX_PERF_INSTALL` (default `/home/pi/helixscreen`), `HELIX_PERF_CTL_SOCK` (default `/run/helixscreen/control.sock`), `HELIX_PERF_BUILD_TREE` (tree `arm_measure.sh` builds), `HELIX_PERF_PROBE` (probe binary for `embedded_gate.sh`).
  - `ARM=<label> BUILD=1|0 BIN_FROM=<arm> ENV_EXTRA="K=V ..." WORKLOADS="..." SAVERS="..." BASELINES="..." scripts/screensaver-perf/arm_measure.sh` writes `$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/results/<ARM>.txt`, `$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/<ARM>_summary.txt`, `$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/<ARM>.done`.
  - `SAVERS="off ui <saver>..." DUR=60 scripts/screensaver-perf/pi3b_gate.sh <arm> <run>`; workload `ui` cycles `home controls filament settings print-select`.
  - `DUR=60 HELIX_PERF_PROBE=<bin> scripts/screensaver-perf/embedded_gate.sh <arm> <run> <label>`.
  - `perf_run_remote scripts/screensaver-perf/pi3b_service.sh ACTION=stop|start|dropin|collect|crashes|journal|display_value|unset_display|app_env|print_state` with `ENV_EXTRA`, `FILE`, `SINCE`, `PATTERN`, `KEY` as the action needs.
  - In `perf_env.sh`: `PERF_PACING_ENV="HELIX_EGL_VSYNC=1 HELIX_LOOP_MIN_SLEEP_MS=1"`, set on every device run; `perf_thermal`; `perf_print_idle <state>`; `perf_pi3b_take <reason>` and `perf_pi3b_release` around direct Pi steps; `perf_app_log` (the log file the running app holds open). Every arm logs `PRINT_STATE`, `APP_ENV ok` and `THERMAL` lines, and removes its drop-in when it finishes.
  - `pi3b_measure.sh` takes `SETTLE_S=<seconds>`: that long with no ctl traffic before the Test Screensaver press.
  - `perf_saver_type <name>` in `perf_env.sh`: `idle|off|ui` 0, `toasters` 1, `starfield` 2, `pipes` 3 (Task 10 adds `fireworks` 4).
  - `python3 scripts/screensaver-perf/summarize.py <results files>` prints `PASS` or `FAIL` per arm and workload under the rule max < 20000 us, p99 < 5000 us, no overflow, samples > 0.

# Screensaver performance measurement

Scripts that measure what a screensaver costs on a real board: CPU per thread, presented
frames, and whether the printer's timing survives it (the load gate). They drive a deployed
app over ssh and `helix-screen ctl`, so they need a build with the control server.

## Settings

Every script sources `perf_env.sh`. Nothing about a device is written in the repo; export these:

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `HELIX_PERF_HOST` | Device address (required) |
| `HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH` | Directory for results, logs, traces and copied binaries, outside the repo (required) |
| `HELIX_PERF_USER` | ssh user, default `pi` |
| `HELIX_PERF_PASSWORD` | ssh and sudo password; unset means key auth and passwordless sudo. Passed to `sshpass -e`, never on a command line |
| `HELIX_PERF_INSTALL` | Install root on the device, default `/home/pi/helixscreen` |
| `HELIX_PERF_CTL_SOCK` | Control socket on the device, default `/run/helixscreen/control.sock` |
| `HELIX_PERF_BUILD_TREE` | Tree `arm_measure.sh` builds with `make pi-docker` |
| `HELIX_PERF_PROBE` | Wake-up probe binary for `embedded_gate.sh` |

## The load gate

A run passes when the latency probe records **no wake-up of 20 ms or more and a p99 under
5 ms**, under a CPU load that stands in for klippy and moonraker. An arm passes only when
every run passes. On the Pi the probe is `cyclictest --laptop --policy=other -i 1000` beside
`stress-ng --cpu 2`; on BusyBox boards it is `wakeup_probe` beside busy loops on half the cores.
`summarize.py` prints the verdict.

## Raspberry Pi 3B

```bash
ARM=my-arm BUILD=1 HELIX_PERF_BUILD_TREE=$PWD \
  setsid nohup scripts/screensaver-perf/arm_measure.sh > "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/my-arm.log" 2>&1 < /dev/null &
```

The arm claims `device:pi3b` with `scripts/helix-claim`, deploys, smoke-tests every saver for
crashes, runs three measurement passes and three load-gate passes, and writes
`$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/my-arm_summary.txt`. `ENV_EXTRA="HELIX_SCREENSAVER_LEVEL=1"` runs the arm
with those variables in a systemd drop-in, which the arm removes (restarting the app) when it
finishes. `SAVERS="off ui"` measures the idle home panel and a loop through the base panels.

Before touching the Pi the arm asks the Moonraker in the app's settings for the print state and
stops unless the printer is idle (`PRINT_STATE` in the log). Every arm runs with
`HELIX_EGL_VSYNC=1 HELIX_LOOP_MIN_SLEEP_MS=1`, which keep 16 ms frames even. They are set rather
than detected, because the app logs neither when it equals the default; the `APP_ENV ok` line
confirms the running app carries them and `ENV_EXTRA` (`env-<ARM>.txt` holds its environment).
A step that drives the Pi by hand runs its commands between `perf_pi3b_take "<reason>"` and
`perf_pi3b_release` from `perf_env.sh`, which claim `device:pi3b` and make the same check.

Every pass appends a `THERMAL` line per workload (`vcgencmd measure_temp`, `get_throttled` and
the ARM clock) and every gate run one sampled mid-run. The Pi 3B throttles under the load gate
(80 to 84 C, `throttled=0x20002`, the ARM clock down to 818 MHz), and a throttled run is not
comparable with an unthrottled one. `summarize.py` ignores these lines; report the hottest
reading and the count of readings with a `throttled` other than `0x0` beside an arm's numbers:

```bash
grep -o "temp=[0-9.]*" "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/results/my-arm.txt" | sort -t= -k2 -n | tail -n 1
grep THERMAL "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/results/my-arm.txt" | grep -v -c "throttled=0x0"
```

Frames come from `strace` of the presenting ioctls: `DRM_IOCTL_MODE_PAGE_FLIP` on the dumb-DRM
binary and `DRM_IOCTL_MODE_ATOMIC` on the EGL binary.

## BusyBox boards (CC1, AD5M)

These boards have no cyclictest, stress-ng or python. Build the probe as a static armv7
binary in the CC1 toolchain image:

```bash
mkdir -p build/screensaver-perf
docker run --rm --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v "$PWD":/src -w /src helixscreen/toolchain-cc1 \
  arm-none-linux-gnueabihf-gcc -std=c99 -O2 -static \
  -o build/screensaver-perf/wakeup_probe-armv7 scripts/screensaver-perf/wakeup_probe.c -lrt
```

Then, with the app already running the workload to measure:

```bash
DUR=60 HELIX_PERF_PROBE=build/screensaver-perf/wakeup_probe-armv7 \
  scripts/screensaver-perf/embedded_gate.sh cc1-fireworks 1 level0
python3 scripts/screensaver-perf/summarize.py "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/results/cc1-fireworks.txt"
```

Never measure while a print runs, and get the board owner's approval before stressing a printer.
````

- [ ] **Step 9: Lint the scripts**

Run:

```bash
shellcheck -S warning -e SC3043,SC1091 scripts/screensaver-perf/*.sh; echo "exit $?"
.venv/bin/pytest tests/python/test_screensaver_perf_parsers.py -q
```

Expected: `exit 0` with no findings; `10 passed`.

- [ ] **Step 10: Index the harness in scripts/CLAUDE.md**

In `scripts/CLAUDE.md`, directly after the table under `### Release & Packaging` (before the next `### ` heading), insert:

```markdown
### Performance Measurement
| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `screensaver-perf/` | Screensaver cost on real boards: CPU per thread, presented frames from DRM ioctls, and the load gate (cyclictest or `wakeup_probe` under load). Device settings come from `HELIX_PERF_*` variables; `screensaver-perf/README.md` has the flows |
```

- [ ] **Step 11: Prove a parser test can fail, then commit**

Mutation: in `scripts/screensaver-perf/flips.py`, change `FLIP_IOCTLS = ("DRM_IOCTL_MODE_PAGE_FLIP", "DRM_IOCTL_MODE_ATOMIC")` to `FLIP_IOCTLS = ("DRM_IOCTL_MODE_PAGE_FLIP",)`, run `.venv/bin/pytest tests/python/test_screensaver_perf_parsers.py -q`, confirm `test_flips_count_page_flip_and_atomic_ioctls_but_not_resumptions` fails, and restore the line.

```bash
git add -- scripts/screensaver-perf tests/python/test_screensaver_perf_parsers.py scripts/CLAUDE.md
git commit -m "tools(screensaver): measurement harness for the Pi 3B and BusyBox boards" -m "Measures a deployed saver's CPU, presented frames and load-gate latency. Device address and credentials come from HELIX_PERF_* variables, the gate verdict and the frame count (page flips and atomic commits) are pinned by pytest, and a static wakeup_probe stands in for cyclictest on boards without it." -m "Mutation: dropped DRM_IOCTL_MODE_ATOMIC from FLIP_IOCTLS; test_flips_count_page_flip_and_atomic_ioctls_but_not_resumptions went red"
```

### Task 1: Registry and type count

One always-compiled header names every saver and derives the count, the clamp, the `HELIX_SCREENSAVER_NOW` names and the dropdown order check from its rows. The hardcoded bound 3 disappears from the manager, the settings manager and the tests.

**Files:**
- Create: `include/screensaver_registry.h`
- Modify: `include/screensaver.h` (remove the `ScreensaverType` enum, include the registry), `src/ui/screensaver_manager.cpp#ScreensaverManager::configured_type`, `src/system/display_settings_manager.cpp#DisplaySettingsManager::init_subjects` and `#DisplaySettingsManager::set_screensaver_type`, `src/application/display_manager.cpp#DisplayManager::check_display_sleep`, `docs/devel/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md` (section `HELIX_SCREENSAVER_NOW`)
- Test: `tests/unit/test_screensaver_registry.cpp` (new), `tests/unit/test_screensaver.cpp` (section `out of range clamped`, one new test case)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing.
- Produces (every later task):
  - `enum class ScreensaverType : int { OFF = 0, FLYING_TOASTERS = 1, STARFIELD = 2, PIPES_3D = 3 };` (global, moved into `include/screensaver_registry.h`; the tree also ships `BOUNCING_PRINTER = 4`, so Task 10 adds `FIREWORKS = 5`)
  - `namespace helix::ui`: `enum SaverDepth : uint8_t { SAVER_DEPTH_16 = 1u << 0, SAVER_DEPTH_32 = 1u << 1 };`
  - `struct ScreensaverInfo { ScreensaverType type; const char* name; const char* label_key; uint8_t depths; };`
  - `inline constexpr ScreensaverInfo SCREENSAVERS[]`, `inline constexpr size_t SCREENSAVER_COUNT`, `inline constexpr const char* SCREENSAVER_OFF_LABEL_KEY = "Off";`
  - `constexpr int screensaver_last_type();`, `constexpr int clamp_screensaver_type(int value);`
  - `constexpr const ScreensaverInfo* find_screensaver(ScreensaverType type);`, `constexpr const ScreensaverInfo* find_screensaver_by_name(std::string_view name);`
  - `constexpr ScreensaverType resolve_screensaver_now(std::string_view value, ScreensaverType configured);`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing registry tests**

In `tests/unit/test_screensaver.cpp`, add `#include "screensaver_registry.h"` below `#include "platform_capabilities.h"`, replace the body of `SECTION("out of range clamped")` with:

```cpp
    SECTION("out of range clamped") {
        DisplaySettingsManager::instance().set_screensaver_type(99);

        DisplaySettingsManager::instance().set_screensaver_type(-1);
        REQUIRE(DisplaySettingsManager::instance().get_screensaver_type() == 0);
    }
```

and add this test case directly after `TEST_CASE_METHOD(LVGLTestFixture, "Screensaver type subject reflects setter", ...)`:

```cpp
TEST_CASE_METHOD(LVGLTestFixture,
                 "a stored or subject screensaver type past the last type clamps to the last type",
                 "[screensaver][display_settings]") {
    Config* config = Config::get_instance();
    const int stored_before = config->get<int>("/display/screensaver_type", 1);
    config->set<int>("/display/screensaver_type", 99);

    DisplaySettingsManager::instance().init_subjects();
    CHECK(DisplaySettingsManager::instance().get_screensaver_type() ==
          helix::ui::screensaver_last_type());

    // The manager clamps what the subject holds, whoever wrote it.
    lv_subject_set_int(DisplaySettingsManager::instance().subject_screensaver_type(), 99);
    CHECK(ScreensaverManager::configured_type() ==
          static_cast<ScreensaverType>(helix::ui::screensaver_last_type()));

    DisplaySettingsManager::instance().deinit_subjects();
    config->set<int>("/display/screensaver_type", stored_before);
}
```

`ScreensaverManager` is declared in `screensaver.h`; add `#include "screensaver.h"` next to the registry include (the file already includes it further down, which is harmless).

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the tests and watch them fail**

Run: `make test -j"$JOBS" > "$SS_SCRATCH/test-build.log" 2>&1; echo "exit $?"`
Expected: `exit 2`; `grep -n 'error' "$SS_SCRATCH/test-build.log"` shows `screensaver_registry.h: No such file or directory`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the registry header**

```

- [ ] **Step 4: Point the enum's users at the registry**

In `include/screensaver.h`, delete the block from `/**` above `enum class ScreensaverType : int {` through its closing `};`, and add `#include "screensaver_registry.h"` above `#ifdef HELIX_ENABLE_SCREENSAVER` (after `#pragma once`).

In `src/ui/screensaver_manager.cpp`, replace the body of `ScreensaverManager::configured_type()` with:

```cpp
ScreensaverType ScreensaverManager::configured_type() {
    const int type_int = helix::DisplaySettingsManager::instance().get_screensaver_type();
    return static_cast<ScreensaverType>(helix::ui::clamp_screensaver_type(type_int));
}
```

In `src/system/display_settings_manager.cpp`, add `#include "screensaver_registry.h"` to the include block, replace `screensaver_type = std::clamp(screensaver_type, 0, 3);` in `init_subjects()` with `screensaver_type = helix::ui::clamp_screensaver_type(screensaver_type);`, and replace `type = std::clamp(type, 0, 3);` in `set_screensaver_type()` with `type = helix::ui::clamp_screensaver_type(type);`.

In `src/application/display_manager.cpp#DisplayManager::check_display_sleep`, replace the `HELIX_SCREENSAVER_NOW` block (from the comment `// HELIX_SCREENSAVER_NOW — force-start screensaver immediately (for testing)` through the closing brace of `if (!screensaver_force_checked)`) with:

```cpp
    // HELIX_SCREENSAVER_NOW: start a screensaver on the first tick. A registered saver name
    // picks that saver; any other value the configured one, or flying toasters.
    static bool screensaver_force_checked = false;
    if (!screensaver_force_checked) {
        screensaver_force_checked = true;
        const char* env = std::getenv("HELIX_SCREENSAVER_NOW");
        if (env) {
            const ScreensaverType force_type =
                helix::ui::resolve_screensaver_now(env, ScreensaverManager::configured_type());
            spdlog::info("[DisplayManager] HELIX_SCREENSAVER_NOW={}, forcing screensaver type {}",
                         env, static_cast<int>(force_type));
            m_display_dimmed = true;
            ScreensaverManager::instance().start(force_type);
            m_screensaver_active = true;
            return;
        }
    }
```

In `docs/devel/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md`, in the `HELIX_SCREENSAVER_NOW` section, replace the **Values** row and the **File** row of its table with:

```markdown
| **Values** | A saver name from `include/screensaver_registry.h#SCREENSAVERS` (`toasters`, `starfield`, `pipes`), or `1` / any other value (uses the configured type, falling back to flying toasters) |
| **File** | `src/application/display_manager.cpp`, names in `include/screensaver_registry.h` |
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Build and run the registry and settings tests**

Run: `make test -j"$JOBS" > "$SS_SCRATCH/test-build.log" 2>&1; echo "exit $?"` then `./build/bin/helix-tests "[screensaver_registry],[display_settings]"` then `./build/bin/helix-tests "[screensaver]"`.
Expected: `exit 0`; all test cases pass, including `the settings dropdown lists Off then every registered screensaver in type order`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Mutate, then commit**

Mutation: in `clamp_screensaver_type`, change `return screensaver_last_type();` inside `if (value > screensaver_last_type())` to `return 0;`, rebuild, and confirm `an out-of-range screensaver type clamps to the last type` and `a stored or subject screensaver type past the last type clamps to the last type` fail. Restore.

```bash
.venv/bin/clang-format -i include/screensaver_registry.h include/screensaver.h src/ui/screensaver_manager.cpp src/system/display_settings_manager.cpp src/application/display_manager.cpp tests/unit/test_screensaver_registry.cpp tests/unit/test_screensaver.cpp

git commit -m "refactor(screensaver): one registry names the savers and bounds the type" -m "The type count, the stored-type clamp, the HELIX_SCREENSAVER_NOW names and the settings dropdown order all derive from one always-compiled row table, so adding a saver touches one row.

```

### Task 2: Pixel fingerprints for pipes and starfield

Records a hash of the canvas pixels for a fixed seed and fixed frame times on the current code, before any refactor, so Tasks 3 and 4 can prove pixel-identical output.

**Files:**
- Create: `tests/unit/test_screensaver_fingerprint.cpp`, `tests/fixtures/screensaver/fingerprints.txt` (written by the test in record mode)
- Test: the same file

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `PipesScreensaverTestAccess::{set_fixed_seed, timer, canvas, set_total_segments, max_segments}`, `StarfieldScreensaverTestAccess::{set_fixed_seed, timer, canvas}` (existing), `ScreensaverStopOnExit` (existing).
- Produces (Tasks 3, 4): tag `[screensaver_fingerprint]`; the six seam functions `seed_pipes`, `pipes_timer`, `pipes_canvas`, `seed_starfield`, `starfield_timer`, `starfield_canvas` at the top of the test file are the only lines a refactor edits; the golden file `tests/fixtures/screensaver/fingerprints.txt` holds lines `pipes <16 hex digits>` and `starfield <16 hex digits>`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the fingerprint test**

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it and watch it fail on the missing recording**

Run: `mkdir -p tests/fixtures/screensaver; make test -j"$JOBS" > "$SS_SCRATCH/test-build.log" 2>&1; echo "exit $?"` then `./build/bin/helix-tests "[screensaver_fingerprint]"`.
Expected: `exit 0`; both "matches its recorded pixel fingerprint" cases fail at `REQUIRE( recorded.count(name) == 1 )`; the replay case passes.

- [ ] **Step 3: Record the fingerprints from the current code**

Run: `HELIX_SCREENSAVER_FINGERPRINT_WRITE=1 ./build/bin/helix-tests "[screensaver_fingerprint]"`
Expected: both recording cases fail with `recorded pipes <hex>` and `recorded starfield <hex>`; `cat tests/fixtures/screensaver/fingerprints.txt` shows the comment line, a `pipes` line and a `starfield` line.

- [ ] **Step 4: Compare against the recording**

Run: `./build/bin/helix-tests "[screensaver_fingerprint]"` twice.
Expected: all three test cases pass both times.

- [ ] **Step 5: Mutate, then commit**

Mutation: in `src/ui/screensaver_pipes.cpp` change `static constexpr float PIPE_RADIUS = 0.22f;` to `0.23f`, rebuild, confirm `the pipes canvas matches its recorded pixel fingerprint` fails; restore. Then in `src/ui/screensaver_starfield_sim.cpp` change `constexpr float COLOR_THRESHOLD = 0.35f;` to `0.36f`, rebuild, confirm `the starfield canvas matches its recorded pixel fingerprint` fails; restore and rebuild.

```bash
.venv/bin/clang-format -i tests/unit/test_screensaver_fingerprint.cpp
git add -- tests/unit/test_screensaver_fingerprint.cpp tests/fixtures/screensaver/fingerprints.txt
git commit -m "test(screensaver): pixel fingerprints of the pipes and starfield canvases" -m "A seeded run at 800x480 with fixed frame times hashes the canvas bytes every few frames, including a pipes grid reset, and compares with the recorded values. The refactors onto the shared saver parts must leave both hashes unchanged." -m "Mutation: PIPE_RADIUS 0.22f to 0.23f and, separately, COLOR_THRESHOLD 0.35f to 0.36f; the pipes and starfield fingerprint tests each went red"
```

### Task 3: Shared saver parts, the saver base, and pipes on them

Builds the foundation every saver runs on (overlay, canvas with dirty-area merge and the dirty-box layer session, frame timer, base class, generic test access) and moves pipes onto it. Level 0 of every ladder runs at 16 ms (`SAVER_FAST_PERIOD`), or at `HELIX_SCREENSAVER_REFR_PERIOD_MS` when that is set for manual testing; levels 1 and up keep their declared periods, and while a saver runs the display refresh follows its current period, so the two stay equal. The pipes fingerprint from Task 2 must not change, and a Pi 3B arm must show no regression.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `helix::ui::screensaver::MotionClock` (`include/screensaver_motion.h`), `helix::ui::screensaver_canvas_stride_bytes(int32_t, lv_color_format_t)` (`include/screensaver.h`), `helix::RefreshPeriodHold` and `helix::active_refresh_period_hold()` (`include/refresh_period_hold.h`), `helix::ui::safe_delete_deferred(lv_obj_t*&)` (`include/ui_utils.h`), `helix::ui::lv_timer_cancel_safe(lv_timer_t*)` (`include/ui_timer_guard.h`), the Task 2 fingerprint seams.
- Produces (Tasks 4, 5, 6, 9, 10):
  - `include/screensaver_frame.h` (pure, `helix::ui`): `inline constexpr uint32_t SAVER_FAST_PERIOD = 16;`, `inline constexpr size_t SAVER_MAX_DIRTY_AREAS = 32;`, `struct DirtyRect { int32_t x1, y1, x2, y2; bool empty() const; int64_t area() const; void add(int32_t, int32_t, int32_t, int32_t); void add(const DirtyRect&); bool operator==(const DirtyRect&) const; };`, `void merge_dirty_areas(std::vector<DirtyRect>& areas, size_t max_areas);`
  - `class SaverOverlay { void create(); void make_transparent(); void destroy(); lv_obj_t* obj() const; };`
  - `class SaverCanvas { bool create(lv_obj_t* parent, int32_t w, int32_t h, lv_color_format_t cf); void release(); lv_obj_t* obj() const; uint8_t* data() const; uint32_t stride() const; size_t buffer_size() const; lv_color_format_t format() const; int32_t width() const; int32_t height() const; void fill_black(); void invalidate(std::vector<DirtyRect>& areas); void begin_layer(lv_layer_t*); void mark_dirty(int32_t x1, int32_t y1, int32_t x2, int32_t y2); void finish_layer(lv_layer_t*); };`
  - `class SaverFrameTimer { using FrameFn = std::function<void(uint32_t dt_ms)>; void start(uint32_t period_ms, FrameFn on_frame); void set_period(uint32_t period_ms); void cancel(); lv_timer_t* timer() const; };`
  - `class SaverBase : public Screensaver` with public `void start() final; void stop() final; bool is_active() const final; size_t level() const; size_t level_count() const; uint32_t level_period_ms(size_t level) const; void set_start_level(size_t level); void request_level(size_t level);`, protected pure virtuals `std::optional<lv_color_format_t> canvas_format() const`, `bool on_start()`, `void on_frame(uint32_t dt_ms, std::vector<DirtyRect>& dirty)`, `void on_stop()`, `size_t ladder_size() const`, `uint32_t ladder_period_ms(size_t level) const`, protected virtual `void on_level_request(size_t level)` (default applies at once), protected `void apply_level(size_t level)` (it and `start()` call `active_refresh_period_hold().follow(period)`), `SaverOverlay& overlay()`, `SaverCanvas& canvas()`, `std::minstd_rand& rng()`, `int32_t screen_w() const`, `int32_t screen_h() const`.
  - `inline constexpr size_t TWO_LEVEL_COUNT = 2;`, `constexpr uint32_t two_level_period_ms(size_t level);` (level 0 `SAVER_FAST_PERIOD`, else 33)
  - `void helix::RefreshPeriodHold::follow(uint32_t saver_period_ms);`: while held, the refresh and animation timers run at the saver's period from then on; `acquire()` is unchanged and still starts them at the configured `period()`. `SaverBase::level_period_ms(0)` returns `RefreshPeriodHold::period()` when one is configured (`HELIX_SCREENSAVER_REFR_PERIOD_MS`), else the ladder's level 0 period; other levels return their ladder period. `ScreensaverManager` is unchanged.
  - Test seam `helix::ui::SaverTestAccess` (`tests/test_helpers/screensaver_test_access.h`, re-exported globally with `using`): `overlay`, `canvas`, `timer`, `draw_buf_size`, `draw_buf_stride`, `set_fixed_seed`; also `struct ScopedGlobalRefreshHold` (the global hold released with no configured period, on entry and exit) and `LevelZeroPeriods level_zero_periods<Saver>(uint32_t configured_ms)` (level 0's timer period and the held display refresh of a fresh saver).

- [ ] **Step 0: Record a Pi 3B control arm on the Task 2 commit**

Preston approved device use this session? Ask him once, before the first Pi 3B command. Then, with `HELIX_PERF_HOST`, `HELIX_PERF_PASSWORD` and `HELIX_PERF_USER` taken from the device roster memory (`reference_ssh_access.md`) and `HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH="$SS_SCRATCH/perf"`:

```bash
git log -1 --format='%h %s'   # the Task 2 fingerprint commit
ARM=task2-control BUILD=1 HELIX_PERF_BUILD_TREE="$PWD" ENV_EXTRA="HELIX_SCREENSAVER_REFR_PERIOD_MS=16" \
  setsid nohup scripts/screensaver-perf/arm_measure.sh > "$SS_SCRATCH/task2-control.log" 2>&1 < /dev/null &
```

`HELIX_SCREENSAVER_REFR_PERIOD_MS=16` runs the Task 2 savers, which tick at the display refresh period, at 16 ms, the period every refactored saver's level 0 runs at, so the arms compare like for like. The refactor arms in Tasks 3, 4 and 5 use the same `ENV_EXTRA`.

The arm runs with `HELIX_EGL_VSYNC=1 HELIX_LOOP_MIN_SLEEP_MS=1` in its drop-in, as every device run in this plan does, since the 57 fps bar in Task 11 assumes that pacing. Once it has deployed, `grep -E '^(PRINT_STATE|APP_ENV)' "$SS_SCRATCH/task2-control.log"` must show a print state that is not `printing` or `paused` and `APP_ENV ok`; either failing stops the arm, and then tell Preston what it printed.

Wait until `$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/arms/task2-control/.sha` exists (the binaries are copied out of the tree) before editing or building anything below; the arm keeps measuring in the background and writes `$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/task2-control.done` at the end. Compare its summary with the 2026-09-14 reference at 16 ms with EGL vsync and a 1 ms loop floor (toasters 58.6 fps and 23.3% CPU, starfield 58.7 fps and 45.9%, pipes 10.0 fps and 8.2%). If any saver differs from the reference by more than 20% of its CPU, stop and tell Preston the board or its firmware changed before any refactor is measured against it.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests for the shared parts**

Then let the display refresh follow the running saver's level. In `include/refresh_period_hold.h`, in the class comment replace

```cpp
 * 30 fps on a 60 Hz panel. While this hold is out, the default display's refresh timer
 * and the animation timer run at period() instead. The refresh timer pauses itself
 * whenever nothing is invalidated, so a shorter period costs nothing on a still frame.
 *
 * - The first acquire() records both timers' periods and sets them to period(). With no
 *   period configured, no default display, or no refresh timer, it changes nothing.
```

with

```cpp
 * 30 fps on a 60 Hz panel. While this hold is out, the default display's refresh timer
 * and the animation timer run at period() instead, and at the running saver's frame period
 * once the saver gives one. The refresh timer pauses itself whenever nothing is
 * invalidated, so a shorter period costs nothing on a still frame.
 *
 * - The first acquire() records both timers' periods and sets them to period(). With no
 *   period configured, no default display, or no refresh timer, it changes nothing.
 * - follow() runs both timers at the saver's frame period from then on, taking them if
 *   acquire() did not. SaverBase gives period() as level 0's frame period when one is
 *   configured, so the saver and the display refresh stay equal at every level.
```

add this declaration directly after `void acquire();`:

```cpp
    /// While held, both timers run at `saver_period_ms`, the running saver's frame period,
    /// until the final release(). Not held, or given 0, it does nothing.
    void follow(uint32_t saver_period_ms);
```

and in the private section replace `    uint32_t m_period_ms = 0;` with:

```cpp
    uint32_t m_period_ms = 0;
    uint32_t m_saver_period_ms = 0; ///< the running saver's frame period while held, or 0

    uint32_t effective_period() const {
        return m_saver_period_ms != 0 ? m_saver_period_ms : m_period_ms;
    }
```

In `src/application/display_manager.cpp`, add `RefreshPeriodHold::follow` after `RefreshPeriodHold::acquire()` (which is unchanged), and replace `RefreshPeriodHold::take_timers()` and `RefreshPeriodHold::release()`, with:

```cpp
void RefreshPeriodHold::follow(uint32_t saver_period_ms) {

            lv_timer_set_period(anim, saver_period_ms);
        }
    }
}

void RefreshPeriodHold::take_timers() {
    const uint32_t period_ms = effective_period();
    if (period_ms == 0 || !lv_is_initialized()) {
        return;
    }
    lv_display_t* disp = lv_display_get_default();
    lv_timer_t* refr = disp != nullptr ? lv_display_get_refr_timer(disp) : nullptr;

        m_saved_anim = true;
        lv_timer_set_period(anim, period_ms);
    }
    spdlog::debug("[RefreshPeriodHold] Refresh period {} ms -> {} ms", m_saved_refr_period_ms,

        return;
    }
    restore_timers();
    m_saver_period_ms = 0;
}
```

In `tests/test_helpers/refresh_period_hold_test_access.h#RefreshPeriodHoldTestAccess::reset`, add `hold.m_saver_period_ms = 0;` after `hold.m_period_ms = 0;`.

In `include/screensaver.h#ScreensaverManager::start`, replace the doc lines

```cpp
     * For the same span the display refreshes at HELIX_SCREENSAVER_REFR_PERIOD_MS when
     * one is configured (helix::RefreshPeriodHold), set before the saver starts so the
     * saver's own timer follows it.
```

with

```cpp
     * For the same span the display refreshes at the running saver's frame period,
     * following its level; level 0 runs at HELIX_SCREENSAVER_REFR_PERIOD_MS when one is
     * configured (helix::RefreshPeriodHold).
```

In `docs/devel/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md`, section `HELIX_SCREENSAVER_REFR_PERIOD_MS`, replace the first paragraph's first two sentences (`Display refresh and animation period while a screensaver runs. Set before the saver starts, so the saver's own tick timer, which follows the refresh period, runs at it too.`) with `Level 0 frame period of every screensaver, for manual testing: the saver draws at it, and the display refreshes and animates at it. Without it, level 0 runs at 16 ms. Levels 1 and up keep their own periods (33 ms and slower) either way, and while a saver runs the display refresh follows it to them.`, replace the table row `| **Default** | Unset: savers run at the global period |` with `| **Default** | Unset: level 0 runs at 16 ms |`, and the row `| **File** | \`include/refresh_period_hold.h\`, \`src/ui/screensaver_manager.cpp\` |` with `| **File** | \`include/refresh_period_hold.h\`, \`src/ui/screensaver_manager.cpp\`, \`src/ui/screensaver_base.cpp\` |`.

- [ ] **Step 8: Wire the build**

In `Makefile`, replace the block

```make
# Exclude screensaver when not enabled
ifneq ($(ENABLE_SCREENSAVER),yes)
    APP_SRCS := $(filter-out $(SRC_DIR)/ui/ui_screensaver.cpp,$(APP_SRCS))
    APP_SRCS := $(filter-out $(SRC_DIR)/ui/screensaver_manager.cpp,$(APP_SRCS))
    APP_SRCS := $(filter-out $(SRC_DIR)/ui/screensaver_starfield.cpp,$(APP_SRCS))
    APP_SRCS := $(filter-out $(SRC_DIR)/ui/screensaver_starfield_sim.cpp,$(APP_SRCS))
    APP_SRCS := $(filter-out $(SRC_DIR)/ui/screensaver_pipes.cpp,$(APP_SRCS))
endif
```

with

```make
# Screensaver sources: every saver, the parts they share and the manager
SCREENSAVER_SRCS := $(SRC_DIR)/ui/ui_screensaver.cpp $(wildcard $(SRC_DIR)/ui/screensaver_*.cpp)
# Exclude screensaver when not enabled
ifneq ($(ENABLE_SCREENSAVER),yes)
    APP_SRCS := $(filter-out $(SCREENSAVER_SRCS),$(APP_SRCS))
endif
```

In `firmware/helixscreen-esp32/components/helixapp/app_srcs_excluded.txt`, replace the four lines from `src/ui/screensaver_manager.cpp  # not in the v1 Core+AMS cut` through `src/ui/screensaver_starfield_sim.cpp  # not in the v1 Core+AMS cut` with:

```
src/ui/screensaver_base.cpp  # not in the v1 Core+AMS cut
src/ui/screensaver_canvas.cpp  # not in the v1 Core+AMS cut
src/ui/screensaver_frame.cpp  # not in the v1 Core+AMS cut

src/ui/screensaver_starfield.cpp  # not in the v1 Core+AMS cut
src/ui/screensaver_starfield_sim.cpp  # not in the v1 Core+AMS cut
```

Run: `python3 scripts/check_esp32_app_srcs.py; echo "exit $?"` and `make -n ENABLE_SCREENSAVER=no > "$SS_SCRATCH/dry-nosaver.log" 2>&1; grep -c 'screensaver_' "$SS_SCRATCH/dry-nosaver.log"`
Expected: `exit 0`; the count is `0`.

- [ ] **Step 9: Build and run the shared-part tests**

Run: `scripts/syntax_check.py src/ui/screensaver_frame.cpp src/ui/screensaver_overlay.cpp src/ui/screensaver_canvas.cpp src/ui/screensaver_frame_timer.cpp src/ui/screensaver_base.cpp` then `make test -j"$JOBS" > "$SS_SCRATCH/test-build.log" 2>&1; echo "exit $?"` then `./build/bin/helix-tests "[screensaver_parts]"`.
Expected: syntax check clean; `exit 0`; every `[screensaver_parts]` case passes. Then `./build/bin/helix-tests "[refresh_period]"`: the two new hold cases and every existing refresh-period case pass.

- [ ] **Step 10: Move pipes onto the base**

Replace `include/screensaver_pipes.h` with:

(`screen_w_` and `screen_h_` each appear three times after the block replacements: once in `setup_camera`, once in `project` and once in the new `on_start` debug line.)

In `tests/test_helpers/screensaver_test_access.h`, delete these members from `PipesScreensaverTestAccess`: `draw_buf_size`, `overlay`, `canvas`, `timer`, `set_fixed_seed`. Then move every pipes call site onto the generic access:

```bash
perl -pi -e 's/\bPipesAccess::(overlay|canvas|timer|set_fixed_seed)\(/SaverTestAccess::$1(/g; s/\bPipesScreensaverTestAccess::(overlay|canvas|timer|set_fixed_seed|draw_buf_size)\(/SaverTestAccess::$1(/g' tests/unit/test_screensaver.cpp tests/unit/test_screensaver_canvas_stride.cpp tests/unit/test_screensaver_pipes_canvas.cpp tests/unit/test_screensaver_motion.cpp tests/unit/test_screensaver_fingerprint.cpp
grep -n -E 'PipesAccess::(overlay|canvas|timer|set_fixed_seed)|PipesScreensaverTestAccess::(overlay|canvas|timer|set_fixed_seed|draw_buf_size)' tests/unit/*.cpp; echo "leftover grep exit $?"
```

Expected: `leftover grep exit 1` (no leftovers).

- [ ] **Step 11: Build and prove pipes did not change**

Run: `scripts/syntax_check.py src/ui/screensaver_pipes.cpp src/application/display_manager.cpp` then `make test -j"$JOBS" > "$SS_SCRATCH/test-build.log" 2>&1; echo "exit $?"` then `./build/bin/helix-tests "[screensaver_fingerprint]"` then `./build/bin/helix-tests "[screensaver],[refresh_period]"` then `python3 scripts/check_timer_destructor_cancel.py; echo "exit $?"`.
Expected: `exit 0`; the pipes and starfield fingerprints pass unchanged; every `[screensaver]` case passes (including `each pipes grow step invalidates less than the canvas and every pixel it changes` and `a pipes grid reset invalidates the whole canvas`); the timer gate exits 0.

- [ ] **Step 12: Measure the pipes refactor on the Pi 3B**

After `task2-control.done` exists:

```bash
ARM=task3-pipes BUILD=1 HELIX_PERF_BUILD_TREE="$PWD" BASELINES="task2-control" ENV_EXTRA="HELIX_SCREENSAVER_REFR_PERIOD_MS=16" \
  setsid nohup scripts/screensaver-perf/arm_measure.sh > "$SS_SCRATCH/task3-pipes.log" 2>&1 < /dev/null &
```

When `$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/task3-pipes.done` exists, read `$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/task3-pipes_summary.txt`. Pass criteria: `CRASHES_DURING_SMOKE=0` and `CRASHES_DURING_MEASUREMENT=0` in the log; its log shows `APP_ENV ok`; its hottest `THERMAL` reading and its count of throttled readings (commands in `scripts/screensaver-perf/README.md`) go in the report beside its numbers; every load-gate row `PASS`; for each saver, task3-pipes mean CPU total is no more than 1.0 percentage point above task2-control's largest run, and mean fps is no more than 1.0 below task2-control's smallest run. A failure blocks the commit: stop and report the two summary rows.

- [ ] **Step 13: Mutate, then commit**

Mutation: in `SaverCanvas::finish_layer`, replace `invalidate(layer_dirty_);` with `lv_obj_invalidate(canvas_);`, rebuild, and confirm `each pipes grow step invalidates less than the canvas and every pixel it changes` and `a saver canvas layer session invalidates only the areas it marked` fail. Restore.

Expected survivor, if `make mutate-diff` or a hand mutation tries it: swapping the hide and the free in `SaverCanvas::release`. `releasing a saver canvas hides it and frees its buffer` sees only the state after `release()` returns, and no refresh can run between two statements of one call on the host, so the order is kept by the comment in `release()` and by review, not by a test. Task 11 Step 10 lists it.

### Task 4: Starfield on the base, with the 32-bit PixelWriter

Moves `FrameTarget` into the shared frame header, adds `PixelWriter` (XRGB8888 path) as the one place pixels are written, and moves starfield onto `SaverBase`. `StarfieldSim` stays. The starfield fingerprint must not change.

**Files:**
- Create: `include/screensaver_pixel_writer.h`
- Modify: `include/screensaver_frame.h` (`PixelFormat`, `Rgb`, `FrameTarget`), `include/screensaver_canvas.h` (`SaverCanvas::frame`), `include/screensaver_starfield_sim.h`, `src/ui/screensaver_starfield_sim.cpp`, `include/screensaver_starfield.h`, `src/ui/screensaver_starfield.cpp`, `tests/test_helpers/screensaver_test_access.h` (`StarfieldScreensaverTestAccess` keeps only star state), `tests/unit/test_screensaver.cpp`, `tests/unit/test_screensaver_canvas_stride.cpp`, `tests/unit/test_screensaver_sim.cpp`, `tests/unit/test_screensaver_motion.cpp`, `tests/unit/test_screensaver_fingerprint.cpp`
- Test: `tests/unit/test_screensaver_pixel_writer.cpp` (new), `[screensaver_fingerprint]`, `[starfield_sim]`, `[screensaver]`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 3 `SaverBase`, `SaverCanvas`, `DirtyRect`, `TWO_LEVEL_COUNT`, `two_level_period_ms`, `SaverTestAccess`, `level_zero_periods`.
- Produces (Tasks 9, 10):
  - `include/screensaver_frame.h`: `enum class PixelFormat : uint8_t { XRGB8888 };` (Task 9 adds `RGB565`), `struct Rgb { uint8_t r, g, b; bool operator==(const Rgb&) const; };`, `struct FrameTarget { uint8_t* data; uint32_t stride; uint32_t w; uint32_t h; PixelFormat format = PixelFormat::XRGB8888; };`
  - `include/screensaver_pixel_writer.h`: `class PixelWriter { explicit PixelWriter(const FrameTarget& frame); bool contains(int32_t x, int32_t y) const; void put(int32_t x, int32_t y, Rgb c); Rgb get(int32_t x, int32_t y) const; void fill(Rgb c); };`
  - `FrameTarget SaverCanvas::frame() const;`
  - `helix::ui::fill_starfield_black` is removed; callers use `PixelWriter(frame).fill(Rgb{0, 0, 0})`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing PixelWriter tests**

In `tests/unit/test_screensaver_motion.cpp`, replace the test case `"StarfieldScreensaver ticks at the display refresh period"` with:

```cpp
TEST_CASE_METHOD(LVGLTestFixture,
                 "StarfieldScreensaver level 0: configured period, else 16 ms, with the refresh equal",
                 "[screensaver][screensaver_motion]") {

    CHECK(periods.refresh_ms == periods.timer_ms);
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the build and watch it fail**

Run: `make test -j"$JOBS" > "$SS_SCRATCH/test-build.log" 2>&1; echo "exit $?"`
Expected: `exit 2`; the log names `screensaver_pixel_writer.h: No such file or directory`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Move FrameTarget into the frame header and write PixelWriter**

In `include/screensaver_frame.h`, insert directly after `inline constexpr size_t SAVER_MAX_DIRTY_AREAS = 32;` and its comment:

```cpp
/// How a FrameTarget stores its pixels.
enum class PixelFormat : uint8_t {
    /// 4 bytes per pixel: B, G, R, and an X byte of 0xFF
    XRGB8888,
};

/// An 8-bit-per-channel colour.
struct Rgb {
    uint8_t r = 0;
    uint8_t g = 0;
    uint8_t b = 0;

    bool operator==(const Rgb& o) const {
        return r == o.r && g == o.g && b == o.b;
    }
};

/// A frame a saver writes pixels into directly: rows start `stride` bytes apart.
struct FrameTarget {
    uint8_t* data = nullptr;
    uint32_t stride = 0;
    uint32_t w = 0;
    uint32_t h = 0;
    PixelFormat format = PixelFormat::XRGB8888;
};
```

    bool contains(int32_t x, int32_t y) const {

    }

    }

    FrameTarget frame_;

```

In `include/screensaver_canvas.h`, add inside `class SaverCanvas`, directly after the `height()` accessor as Task 3 wrote it (the three lines `int32_t height() const {`, `return h_;`, `}`):

```cpp
    /// The buffer as a frame for direct pixel writes, for a canvas in a format PixelWriter writes.
    FrameTarget frame() const {
        return {buf_, stride_, static_cast<uint32_t>(w_), static_cast<uint32_t>(h_),
                PixelFormat::XRGB8888};
    }
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the PixelWriter tests**

Run: `make test -j"$JOBS" > "$SS_SCRATCH/test-build.log" 2>&1; echo "exit $?"` then `./build/bin/helix-tests "[pixel_writer]"`.
Expected: the build fails in `include/screensaver_starfield_sim.h` with `redefinition of 'struct helix::ui::FrameTarget'`; continue to Step 5, which removes the old definition, then expect `exit 0` and all three `[pixel_writer]` cases passing.

- [ ] **Step 5: Write the starfield simulation on PixelWriter**

In `include/screensaver_starfield_sim.h`, delete the `struct FrameTarget { ... };` definition with its doc comment and the declaration `void fill_starfield_black(FrameTarget& target);` with its comment. The file keeps `#include "screensaver_frame.h"` from Task 3.

When `task4-starfield.done` exists, apply the Task 3 Step 12 pass criteria against `task2-control`. A failure blocks the commit.

- [ ] **Step 9: Mutate, then commit**

Mutation: in `PixelWriter::put`, change `p[3] = 0xFF;` to `p[3] = 0x00;`, rebuild, confirm `PixelWriter writes XRGB8888 as B, G, R and an opaque X byte`, `every X byte of a StarfieldSim frame stays 0xFF as stars move and recycle` and `the starfield canvas matches its recorded pixel fingerprint` fail. Restore.

### Task 5: Toasters on the base

Moves flying toasters onto `SaverBase` with an overlay, a frame timer and no canvas, on a three-rung ladder: 16 ms with every sprite, 33 ms with every sprite, 33 ms with 10 sprites. The lowest rung takes over the tier-based sprite cap; until the gate lands in Task 6, a BASIC or EMBEDDED board still flies the capped count at every level, so the Pi 3B arm stays like for like. The existing toaster tests keep their assertions except the level 0 period; the per-saver timer switch in the manager tests collapses onto the generic access, `screensaver_timer_period_ms()` loses its last caller and goes, and the refresh-period tests configure 20 ms, apart from the 16 ms default.

**Files:**
- Modify: `include/ui_screensaver.h` (rewritten), `src/ui/ui_screensaver.cpp` (lifecycle, frame and sprite-cap sections), `include/screensaver.h` and `src/ui/screensaver_manager.cpp` (`screensaver_timer_period_ms` removed), `tests/test_helpers/screensaver_test_access.h` (`FlyingToasterScreensaverTestAccess::tick_timer` removed), `tests/unit/test_screensaver.cpp` (toaster timer call sites, `running_saver_timer_period`, the toaster period case, the refresh-period cases, one new test case)
- Test: `[screensaver]`, `[screensaver_motion]`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 3 `SaverBase` (including the `on_level_request` hook), `SaverTestAccess`, `SAVER_FAST_PERIOD`, `ScopedRefreshPeriod`, `ScopedGlobalRefreshHold`, `level_zero_periods`.
- Produces (Task 6): all three existing savers derive from `helix::ui::SaverBase`, so `static_cast<helix::ui::SaverBase&>` on any registered `Screensaver` is valid; toasters have `ladder_size() == 3` with `LEVEL_PERIODS_MS = {SAVER_FAST_PERIOD, 33, 33}`, `CAPPED_LEVEL = 2`, private `size_t sprite_limit(size_t level) const`, `void drop_sprites_past(size_t limit)` and `bool m_low_tier` (removed in Task 6); `FlyingToasterScreensaverTestAccess` keeps `sprites`, `frames_decoded`, `frame_of`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing ladder test and the generic timer helper**

In `tests/unit/test_screensaver.cpp`, replace the whole body of `uint32_t running_saver_timer_period(ScreensaverType type)` with:

```cpp
uint32_t running_saver_timer_period(ScreensaverType type) {

Then move the toaster period case onto the shared level 0 helper, and configure 20 ms in the refresh-period cases so the configured period is visibly not the default. Save as `$SS_SCRATCH/toaster_period_tests.py` and run it before the `perl` below:

```python
from pathlib import Path

path = Path("tests/unit/test_screensaver.cpp")
text = path.read_text()


def replace_once(old, new):
    global text
    assert text.count(old) == 1, old[:60]
    text = text.replace(old, new)


case_start = text.index('TEST_CASE_METHOD(LVGLTestFixture, "FlyingToasterScreensaver ticks at the display refresh period",')

    const LevelZeroPeriods periods = level_zero_periods<FlyingToasterScreensaver>(configured_ms);
    CHECK(periods.timer_ms == (configured_ms != 0 ? configured_ms : helix::ui::SAVER_FAST_PERIOD));
    CHECK(periods.refresh_ms == periods.timer_ms);
}
''' + text[case_end:]
replace_once("constexpr uint32_t SAVER_PERIOD_MS = 16;",
             "// Unlike the 16 ms default, so the checks see the configured period reach each saver.\n"
             "constexpr uint32_t SAVER_PERIOD_MS = 20;")
replace_once('setenv("HELIX_SCREENSAVER_REFR_PERIOD_MS", "16", 1);', 'setenv("HELIX_SCREENSAVER_REFR_PERIOD_MS", "20", 1);')
replace_once("""    // The saver reads the refresh period when it starts, so this is only the configured
    // value if the period was set before start().
""", """    // A saver reads the configured period as it starts, as its level 0 frame period.
""")
path.write_text(text)
print("toaster and refresh-period cases updated")
```

Move the toaster timer call sites to the generic access:

```bash
perl -pi -e 's/\bToasterAccess::tick_timer\(/SaverTestAccess::timer(/g; s/\bFlyingToasterScreensaverTestAccess::tick_timer\(/SaverTestAccess::timer(/g' tests/unit/test_screensaver.cpp
```

`screensaver_base.h` (Task 3) and `platform_capabilities.h` are already included.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the build and watch it fail**

Run: `make test -j"$JOBS" > "$SS_SCRATCH/test-build.log" 2>&1; echo "exit $?"`
Expected: `exit 2`; the log reports that `FlyingToasterScreensaver` has no member `level_count` and cannot convert to `const helix::ui::SaverBase&`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Rewrite the toaster header**

In `tests/test_helpers/screensaver_test_access.h`, delete the `tick_timer` member from `FlyingToasterScreensaverTestAccess`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Build and run the saver tests**

Run: `scripts/syntax_check.py src/ui/ui_screensaver.cpp src/ui/screensaver_manager.cpp` then `make test -j"$JOBS" > "$SS_SCRATCH/test-build.log" 2>&1; echo "exit $?"` then `./build/bin/helix-tests "[screensaver]"` then `python3 scripts/check_timer_destructor_cancel.py; echo "exit $?"`.
Expected: `exit 0`; every `[screensaver]` case passes, including the `FlyingToasterScreensaver ...` motion cases, `FlyingToasterScreensaver level 0: configured period, else 16 ms, with the refresh equal`, the refresh-period cases at a configured 20 ms and `each existing saver runs 16 ms at level 0, then 33 ms, without a motion jump`; the gate exits 0.

- [ ] **Step 6: Measure the toaster refactor on the Pi 3B**

```bash
ARM=task5-toasters BUILD=1 HELIX_PERF_BUILD_TREE="$PWD" BASELINES="task2-control task4-starfield" ENV_EXTRA="HELIX_SCREENSAVER_REFR_PERIOD_MS=16" \
  setsid nohup scripts/screensaver-perf/arm_measure.sh > "$SS_SCRATCH/task5-toasters.log" 2>&1 < /dev/null &
```

When `task5-toasters.done` exists, apply the Task 3 Step 12 pass criteria against `task2-control`. The Pi 3B is still BASIC, so toasters fly the capped count in both arms. A failure blocks the commit.

- [ ] **Step 7: Mutate, then commit**

Mutation: in `src/ui/ui_screensaver.cpp#FlyingToasterScreensaver::sprite_limit`, change `const bool capped = m_low_tier || level >= CAPPED_LEVEL;` to `const bool capped = m_low_tier;`, rebuild, confirm the two toaster sections of `each existing saver runs 16 ms at level 0, then 33 ms, without a motion jump` fail on `sprites(ss).size() == 10`. Restore.

```bash
.venv/bin/clang-format -i include/ui_screensaver.h src/ui/ui_screensaver.cpp include/screensaver.h src/ui/screensaver_manager.cpp tests/test_helpers/screensaver_test_access.h tests/unit/test_screensaver.cpp

Every running saver measures its own CPU cost. `ScreensaverManager` samples process CPU time on the display manager's idle-check tick, keeps an idle baseline, closes 5 s windows after a 1 s warm-up, and asks a pure decision function whether to keep the level, step down or mark the board too heavy. Levels are stored per saver, app version and board. Two environment switches override the budget or force a level. Toasters stop reading the platform tier; their lowest ladder rung keeps the sprite cap.

**Files:**
- Create: `include/env_whole_number.h`, `include/screensaver_cpu_clock.h`, `src/ui/screensaver_cpu_clock.cpp`, `include/screensaver_gate.h`, `src/ui/screensaver_gate.cpp`, `include/screensaver_level_store.h`, `src/ui/screensaver_level_store.cpp`
- Modify: `include/refresh_timing_env.h#refresh_timing_detail::ms_from_env`, `include/display_backend.h` (new `display_backend_key`), `include/screensaver.h` (rewritten: `SaverHost`, gate members), `src/ui/screensaver_manager.cpp` (rewritten), `include/display_manager.h` (`DisplayManager::screensaver_host`), `src/application/display_manager.cpp#DisplayManager::init`, `#DisplayManager::check_display_sleep`, `#DisplayManager::screensaver_host`, `include/ui_screensaver.h` and `src/ui/ui_screensaver.cpp` (no tier input), `tests/unit/test_screensaver.cpp` (the Task 5 host guard goes), `tests/test_helpers/screensaver_manager_test_access.h`, `docs/devel/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md`, `docs/user/CONFIGURATION.md`, `firmware/helixscreen-esp32/components/helixapp/app_srcs_excluded.txt`
- Test: `tests/unit/test_screensaver_gate.cpp` (new, pure), `tests/unit/test_screensaver_gate_manager.cpp` (new, manager), `tests/unit/application/test_display_screensaver_gate.cpp` (new, DisplayManager wiring), `[refresh_timing]` (unchanged, must stay green)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 1 `ScreensaverInfo`, `find_screensaver`; Task 3 `SaverBase::{level, level_count, set_start_level, request_level}`, `SaverOverlay`; Task 5 (every saver is a `SaverBase`; toasters have three levels); Task 0 `arm_measure.sh`, `pi3b_service.sh ACTION=dropin|stop|start|journal|display_value|unset_display`, `pi3b_measure.sh` (`SETTLE_S`), `perf_pi3b_take`, `perf_pi3b_release`, `PERF_PACING_ENV`.
- Produces (Tasks 8, 10, 11):

In `firmware/helixscreen-esp32/components/helixapp/app_srcs_excluded.txt`, add these three lines inside the screensaver block, keeping it alphabetical (after `screensaver_canvas.cpp`, after `screensaver_frame_timer.cpp`, and after `screensaver_gate.cpp` respectively):

```
src/ui/screensaver_cpu_clock.cpp  # not in the v1 Core+AMS cut
src/ui/screensaver_gate.cpp  # not in the v1 Core+AMS cut
src/ui/screensaver_level_store.cpp  # not in the v1 Core+AMS cut
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the pure tests**

Run: `python3 scripts/check_esp32_app_srcs.py; echo "exit $?"` then `make test -j"$JOBS" > "$SS_SCRATCH/test-build.log" 2>&1; echo "exit $?"` then `./build/bin/helix-tests "[screensaver_gate]"` then `./build/bin/helix-tests "[refresh_timing]"`.
Expected: `exit 0` twice; every `[screensaver_gate]` case passes; `[refresh_timing]` stays green.

- [ ] **Step 6: Write the failing manager and wiring tests**

#endif // HELIX_ENABLE_SCREENSAVER
```

- [ ] **Step 10: Wire the display manager and drop the toasters' tier input**

In `include/display_manager.h`, directly above `class DisplayManager : public helix::ICalibrationSink {`, insert:

```cpp
#ifdef HELIX_ENABLE_SCREENSAVER
struct SaverHost;
#endif
```

and directly after `void preview_screensaver(int type);` (inside its `#ifdef HELIX_ENABLE_SCREENSAVER` block) insert:

```cpp

    /**
     * @brief What the screensaver gate needs from this app
     *
     * The print callback asks job_holds_machine() of the published print lifecycle; the
     * display path is `backend`'s display_backend_key(), or "unknown" without a backend.
     */
    static SaverHost screensaver_host(const DisplayBackend* backend);
```

In `src/application/display_manager.cpp`:

1. In `DisplayManager::init`, directly after the closing brace of the `if (m_refresh_timing.refr_period_ms != 0 || ...)` block that logs `Refresh pacing`, insert:

```cpp
#ifdef HELIX_ENABLE_SCREENSAVER
    // The gate halves the screensaver budget during prints and keys stored levels by display path.
    ScreensaverManager::instance().set_host(screensaver_host(m_backend.get()));
#endif
```

2. In `DisplayManager::check_display_sleep`, make the first statement inside its `#ifdef HELIX_ENABLE_SCREENSAVER` block (above the `HELIX_SCREENSAVER_NOW` comment):

```cpp
    ScreensaverManager::instance().on_idle_check_tick();
```

3. Directly before `void DisplayManager::preview_screensaver(int type) {` (inside the same `#ifdef HELIX_ENABLE_SCREENSAVER`), add:

```cpp
SaverHost DisplayManager::screensaver_host(const DisplayBackend* backend) {
    SaverHost host;
    host.is_printing = [] { return job_holds_machine(get_printer_state().get_print_lifecycle()); };
    host.display_backend =
        backend ? display_backend_key(backend->type(), backend->is_gpu_accelerated()) : "unknown";
    return host;
}

```

Save as `$SS_SCRATCH/toasters_no_tier.py` and run it. The lowest ladder rung keeps the sprite cap; only the tier input goes, and with it the host guard in the Task 5 ladder test:

```python
import re
from pathlib import Path

header = Path("include/ui_screensaver.h")
h = header.read_text()
# clang-format may pad the trailing comment to line up with its neighbours.
h, count = re.subn(r"^    bool m_low_tier = false; +//[^\n]*\n", "", h, flags=re.M)
assert count == 1, count
header.write_text(h)

source = Path("src/ui/ui_screensaver.cpp")
s = source.read_text()
edits = [
    ('#include "platform_capabilities.h"\n\n', ""),
    ("    const auto caps = helix::PlatformCapabilities::detect();\n    m_low_tier = !caps.supports_animations;\n\n", ""),
    ("    const bool capped = m_low_tier || level >= CAPPED_LEVEL;", "    const bool capped = level >= CAPPED_LEVEL;"),
    ("// Sprites flown at the lowest level, and at every level on a BASIC or EMBEDDED board: every\n"
     "// visible sprite costs dirty-region work each frame. OBJECTS[] is ordered by delay and wave,\n"
     "// so the first ones keep a representative mix.\n",
     "// Sprites flown at the lowest level: every visible sprite costs dirty-region work each frame.\n"
     "// OBJECTS[] is ordered by delay and wave, so the first ones keep a representative mix.\n"),
]
for old, new in edits:
    assert s.count(old) == 1, old[:60]
    s = s.replace(old, new)
assert "m_low_tier" not in s and "PlatformCapabilities" not in s
source.write_text(s)

test = Path("tests/unit/test_screensaver.cpp")
u = test.read_text()
guard = (
    "        if (!helix::PlatformCapabilities::detect().supports_animations) {\n"
    '            SKIP("BASIC and EMBEDDED hosts fly ten sprites at every level until the gate lands");\n'
    "        }\n"
)
assert u.count(guard) == 1
test.write_text(u.replace(guard, ""))
print("toasters no longer read the tier")
```

- [ ] **Step 11: Document the switches and the stored levels**

In `docs/devel/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md`, insert directly above the heading `### \`HELIX_LOOP_MIN_SLEEP_MS\``:

````markdown
### `HELIX_SCREENSAVER_BUDGET_PCT`

Replaces the screensaver gate's CPU budget, as a whole percent of one core. Each 5 s window of a running saver's CPU share, with the idle baseline subtracted, is compared with this number instead of the core-count budget (4 or more cores 50%, 3 cores 37%, 2 cores 25%, 1 core 10%, halved while a print runs), so a small value proves on a device that a saver steps down and remembers its level. Read when a saver starts.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Values** | Whole percent, `1` to `400` |
| **Default** | Unset: the core-count budget |
| **Invalid** | Anything else (`0`, `25%`, `-5`, empty) is ignored with a warning |
| **File** | `include/screensaver_gate.h#saver_env_overrides`, `src/ui/screensaver_manager.cpp` |

```bash
HELIX_SCREENSAVER_BUDGET_PCT=5 HELIX_SCREENSAVER_NOW=toasters ./build/bin/helix-screen --test -vv
```

Requires a build with `HELIX_ENABLE_SCREENSAVER`.

### `HELIX_SCREENSAVER_LEVEL`

Runs every saver that starts at this quality level and turns the gate off for that run: no step-down and no stored level. Level 0 is the most expensive. A level past the saver's ladder is ignored with a warning, and the stored level is used. Read when a saver starts.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Values** | Whole level number, `0` to `99` |
| **Default** | Unset: the stored level for this saver, app version and board |
| **Invalid** | Ignored with a warning |
| **File** | `include/screensaver_gate.h#saver_env_overrides`, `src/ui/screensaver_manager.cpp` |

```bash
HELIX_SCREENSAVER_LEVEL=1 HELIX_SCREENSAVER_NOW=pipes ./build/bin/helix-screen --test -vv
```

Requires a build with `HELIX_ENABLE_SCREENSAVER`.

````

In `docs/user/CONFIGURATION.md`, insert directly above the heading `### \`drm_device\``:

```markdown
### `screensaver_levels`
**Type:** object
**Default:** absent
**Description:** Written by HelixScreen; do not edit it. Each screensaver measures how much processor time it uses while it plays. If it would slow the printer, it lowers its frame rate or detail, and if even its lowest setting is too much it shows a plain black screen instead. The result is kept here for each screensaver, with the HelixScreen version and a description of the screen hardware, and is measured again after an update or on different hardware. Delete this entry to have every screensaver measured again.

```

- [ ] **Step 12: Build and run everything the gate touches**

Run: `scripts/syntax_check.py src/ui/screensaver_manager.cpp src/application/display_manager.cpp src/ui/ui_screensaver.cpp src/ui/screensaver_gate.cpp src/ui/screensaver_level_store.cpp src/ui/screensaver_cpu_clock.cpp` then `make test -j"$JOBS" > "$SS_SCRATCH/test-build.log" 2>&1; echo "exit $?"` then `./build/bin/helix-tests "[screensaver_gate]"` then `./build/bin/helix-tests "[screensaver],[refresh_timing],[refresh_period],[screen_hide],[display]"` then `make -j"$JOBS" > "$SS_SCRATCH/app-build.log" 2>&1; echo "exit $?"`.
Expected: every case passes, including the six manager gate cases and the two DisplayManager wiring cases; both builds `exit 0`.

Then a local mock run proves the manager logs a level:

```bash
TREE=$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)")
export HELIX_SOCK="/tmp/helix-$TREE.sock" HELIX_CONFIG_DIR="/tmp/helix-config-$TREE"
mkdir -p "$HELIX_CONFIG_DIR"
SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy HELIX_SCREENSAVER_BUDGET_PCT=1 HELIX_SCREENSAVER_NOW=starfield \
  ./build/bin/helix-screen --test -vv --remote-socket "$HELIX_SOCK" > "$SS_SCRATCH/mock-gate.log" 2>&1 &
MOCK_PID=$!
```

Wait until `grep -c 'showing a black screen' "$SS_SCRATCH/mock-gate.log"` prints `1` (about 12 s after startup; poll with a Monitor until-loop, not a sleep), then `kill "$MOCK_PID"`.
Expected in the log, in order: `Type 2 running at level 0`, `starfield used ... stepping down to level 1`, `starfield used ... showing a black screen`. `python3 -c 'import json; print(json.load(open("'"$HELIX_CONFIG_DIR"'/settings.json"))["display"]["screensaver_levels"])'` shows `starfield` with `"level": 1, "too_heavy": true`. Delete `$HELIX_CONFIG_DIR` afterwards.

- [ ] **Step 13: Prove the gate end to end on the Pi 3B, and re-run the load gate**

Preston approved device use this session (Task 3 Step 0)? If not, ask him first. Each `arm_measure.sh` arm below claims the Pi and checks the print state itself. The commands that drive the Pi directly run between `perf_pi3b_take` and `perf_pi3b_release`, and no arm is started while that claim is held; a failing `perf_pi3b_take` stops the step.

With the Task 3 Step 0 settings exported, clear any stored levels, then measure the gate build with no refresh override (the display follows each saver's level) under its default budget:

```bash
. scripts/screensaver-perf/perf_env.sh
SVC=scripts/screensaver-perf/pi3b_service.sh
perf_pi3b_take "clear stored saver levels" || exit 1
perf_run_remote "$SVC" ACTION=unset_display KEY=screensaver_levels
perf_pi3b_release
ARM=task6-gate BUILD=1 HELIX_PERF_BUILD_TREE="$PWD" BASELINES="task2-control task5-toasters" \
  setsid nohup scripts/screensaver-perf/arm_measure.sh > "$SS_SCRATCH/task6-gate.log" 2>&1 < /dev/null &
```

When `task6-gate.done` exists, apply the Task 3 Step 12 pass criteria against `task5-toasters` for starfield and pipes. Toasters now fly every sprite on the Pi 3B at levels 0 and 1, since the tier no longer caps them, so their CPU is expected above `task5-toasters`; they must still pass the load gate.

The forced budget has to fall between what toasters cost at level 0 (16 ms, every sprite) and at level 1 (33 ms, every sprite), so the proof steps exactly once. Measure both rungs with the gate off, one arm after the other:

```bash
perf_pi3b_take "clear stored saver levels" || exit 1
perf_run_remote "$SVC" ACTION=unset_display KEY=screensaver_levels
perf_pi3b_release
ARM=task6-toasters-l0 BUILD=0 BIN_FROM=task6-gate ENV_EXTRA="HELIX_SCREENSAVER_LEVEL=0" WORKLOADS="idle toasters" SAVERS="toasters" \
  setsid nohup scripts/screensaver-perf/arm_measure.sh > "$SS_SCRATCH/task6-toasters-l0.log" 2>&1 < /dev/null &
```

and, after `task6-toasters-l0.done`, the same with `ARM=task6-toasters-l1` and `ENV_EXTRA="HELIX_SCREENSAVER_LEVEL=1"`. Then compute the budget from the two arms' net CPU (toasters minus idle):

```bash
BUDGET=$(python3 - "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/results/task6-toasters-l0.txt" "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/results/task6-toasters-l1.txt" <<'PY'
import re
import statistics
import sys


def net(path):
    idle, toasters = [], []
    for line in open(path):
        match = re.match(r"^\S+ run=\d+ (idle|toasters) CPU total=([\d.]+)", line)
        if match:
            (idle if match.group(1) == "idle" else toasters).append(float(match.group(2)))
    return statistics.mean(toasters) - statistics.mean(idle)


level0, level1 = net(sys.argv[1]), net(sys.argv[2])
print(f"toasters net CPU: level 0 {level0:.1f}%, level 1 {level1:.1f}%", file=sys.stderr)
if level0 - level1 < 4.0:
    sys.exit("the two rungs differ by under 4 points of a core, so a forced budget cannot show one step")
print(round((level0 + level1) / 2))
PY
)
echo "budget: ${BUDGET:-none}"
```

An empty budget stops the proof: report the two net figures to Preston. Otherwise run it, holding the Pi until the proof is over:

```bash
perf_pi3b_take "forced-budget gate proof" || exit 1
perf_run_remote "$SVC" ACTION=unset_display KEY=screensaver_levels
perf_run_remote "$SVC" ACTION=dropin "ENV_EXTRA=$PERF_PACING_ENV HELIX_SCREENSAVER_BUDGET_PCT=$BUDGET"
perf_run_remote "$SVC" ACTION=stop
perf_run_remote "$SVC" ACTION=start
since=$(date -u '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
perf_run_remote scripts/screensaver-perf/pi3b_measure.sh TYPE=1 SETTLE_S=12
perf_run_remote "$SVC" ACTION=journal "SINCE=$since" "PATTERN=running at level|stepping down|black screen"
perf_run_remote "$SVC" ACTION=display_value KEY=screensaver_levels
```

`SETTLE_S=12` holds the Test Screensaver press back for 12 s with no ctl traffic, so the idle baseline the gate subtracts is the settled app and not its startup and the navigation to the button; with a baseline inflated by those, a midpoint budget can sit above the measured cost and never step. Expected: `Type 1 running at level 0 (16 ms frames` then `toasters used NN.N% of a core against a <BUDGET>.0% budget; stepping down to level 1`, no second step and no `black screen` line (level 1 costs less than the budget), and `{"toasters": {"board": "egl/4c/...", "level": 1, "too_heavy": false, "version": "..."}}`.

Restart and confirm the stored level is used:

```bash
perf_run_remote "$SVC" ACTION=stop
perf_run_remote "$SVC" ACTION=start
since=$(date -u '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
perf_run_remote scripts/screensaver-perf/pi3b_measure.sh TYPE=1 SETTLE_S=12
perf_run_remote "$SVC" ACTION=journal "SINCE=$since" "PATTERN=running at level"
```

Expected: `Type 1 running at level 1 (33 ms frames`. Put the Pi back and release it: `perf_run_remote "$SVC" ACTION=dropin ENV_EXTRA=`, then `perf_run_remote "$SVC" ACTION=unset_display KEY=screensaver_levels` (which restarts the app without the drop-in), then `perf_pi3b_release`. Put the net CPU figures, the budget and the two journal excerpts in the report to Preston; the Step 14 commit body states the result without this run's numbers.

- [ ] **Step 14: Mutate, then commit**

Mutation: in `SaverGateSession::add`, delete the `if (warming_up_) { ... }` block (so the warm-up second counts), rebuild, and confirm `a gate session ignores the first second, then measures 5 s windows net of the baseline` fails. Restore.

### Task 7: Flying toasters for fresh installs, and the user docs

A fresh install selects flying toasters on every board that builds screensavers; the gate from Task 6 decides what the board can afford. Stored choices, including the ones config migration v16 turned off, stay as they are. The user docs and the settings template stop describing the old tier default.

**Files:**
- Modify: `include/screensaver_registry.h` (`DEFAULT_SCREENSAVER_TYPE`), `src/system/display_settings_manager.cpp#DisplaySettingsManager::init_subjects`, `docs/user/CONFIGURATION.md` (`screensaver_type`), `docs/user/guide/settings/display-sound.md` (`### Screensaver`), `config/settings.json.template` (`_screensaver_type_comment`)
- Test: `tests/unit/test_screensaver.cpp` (the tier default test becomes the fresh-install default test), `tests/unit/test_screensaver_registry.cpp` (one new case)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 1 registry.
- Produces (Task 10 docs, Task 11): `inline constexpr ScreensaverType helix::ui::DEFAULT_SCREENSAVER_TYPE = ScreensaverType::FLYING_TOASTERS;`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing default tests**

In `tests/unit/test_screensaver.cpp`, replace the whole first test case (`TEST_CASE_METHOD(LVGLTestFixture, "Screensaver defaults to tier-appropriate screensaver type when compiled in", ...)`) with:

```cpp
TEST_CASE_METHOD(LVGLTestFixture,
                 "a fresh install defaults the screensaver to flying toasters on every tier",
                 "[screensaver][display_settings]") {
    Config* config = Config::get_instance();
    const bool had_type = config->exists("/display/screensaver_type");
    const int stored_type = config->get<int>("/display/screensaver_type", 0);
    const bool had_legacy = config->exists("/display/screensaver_enabled");
    const bool stored_legacy = config->get<bool>("/display/screensaver_enabled", true);
    if (had_type) {
        config->get_json("/display").erase("screensaver_type");
    }
    if (had_legacy) {
        config->get_json("/display").erase("screensaver_enabled");
    }

    DisplaySettingsManager::instance().init_subjects();
    CHECK(DisplaySettingsManager::instance().get_screensaver_type() ==
          static_cast<int>(helix::ui::DEFAULT_SCREENSAVER_TYPE));
    DisplaySettingsManager::instance().deinit_subjects();

    if (had_type) {
        config->set<int>("/display/screensaver_type", stored_type);
    }
    if (had_legacy) {
        config->set<bool>("/display/screensaver_enabled", stored_legacy);
    }
}
```

In `tests/unit/test_screensaver_registry.cpp`, append:

```cpp
TEST_CASE("fresh installs default to flying toasters, a registered saver",
          "[screensaver][screensaver_registry]") {
    CHECK(helix::ui::DEFAULT_SCREENSAVER_TYPE == ScreensaverType::FLYING_TOASTERS);
    CHECK(helix::ui::find_screensaver(helix::ui::DEFAULT_SCREENSAVER_TYPE) != nullptr);
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the build and watch it fail**

Run: `make test -j"$JOBS" > "$SS_SCRATCH/test-build.log" 2>&1; echo "exit $?"`
Expected: `exit 2`; the log reports `DEFAULT_SCREENSAVER_TYPE` is not a member of `helix::ui`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Add the default and use it**

In `include/screensaver_registry.h`, insert directly after `inline constexpr const char* SCREENSAVER_OFF_LABEL_KEY = "Off";`:

```cpp

/// Type a fresh install runs, on every board that builds screensavers. The screensaver gate
/// measures it there and steps it down, or shows a black screen, when it costs too much.
inline constexpr ScreensaverType DEFAULT_SCREENSAVER_TYPE = ScreensaverType::FLYING_TOASTERS;
```

In `src/system/display_settings_manager.cpp#DisplaySettingsManager::init_subjects`, inside `#ifdef HELIX_ENABLE_SCREENSAVER`, replace the comment block that begins `// Screensaver type` together with the line `const int screensaver_default = PlatformCapabilities::detect().supports_animations ? 1 : 0;` with:

```cpp
    // Screensaver type. A fresh install runs the registry default on every tier; a stored
    // choice is kept as it is.
    const int screensaver_default = static_cast<int>(helix::ui::DEFAULT_SCREENSAVER_TYPE);
```

and, in the `else if (config->exists("/display/screensaver_enabled"))` branch, replace its three comment lines (beginning `// Legacy migration:`) with:

```cpp
        // Legacy screensaver_enabled: true reads as the default type, false as Off.
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests**

Run: `make test -j"$JOBS" > "$SS_SCRATCH/test-build.log" 2>&1; echo "exit $?"` then `./build/bin/helix-tests "[display_settings],[screensaver_registry]"` then `./build/bin/helix-tests "[config][migration][v16]"`.
Expected: `exit 0`; every case passes, and the v16 migration tests are unchanged.

- [ ] **Step 5: Correct the user docs and the template**

In `docs/user/CONFIGURATION.md`, in the `### \`screensaver_type\`` section, append to the end of its **Description:** paragraph:

```markdown
 A fresh install selects Flying Toasters on every device that has screensavers. Each screensaver checks its own cost on your device and lowers its frame rate or detail, or shows a plain black screen, if it would slow the printer (see `screensaver_levels`).
```

In `docs/user/guide/settings/display-sound.md`, under `### Screensaver`, replace the two table rows

```markdown
| **Off** (default) | No screensaver — the screen dims/sleeps normally |
| **Flying Toasters** | Classic flying toasters animation |
```

with

```markdown
| **Off** | No screensaver; the screen dims and sleeps normally |
| **Flying Toasters** (default) | Classic flying toasters animation |
```

and insert this paragraph directly after the table:

```markdown
Each screensaver checks how much processor time it uses on your printer's screen. If it would slow the printer, it lowers its frame rate or detail, and if even that is too much it shows a black screen instead. It remembers the result and checks again after an update.
```

In `config/settings.json.template`, replace the value of `"_screensaver_type_comment"` with:

```json
"Screensaver shown when the display dims. 0=Off, 1=Flying Toasters (default), 2=Starfield, 3=3D Pipes. Replaces legacy screensaver_enabled boolean."
```

Run: `python3 -c 'import json; json.load(open("config/settings.json.template")); print("template ok")'`
Expected: `template ok`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Mutate, then commit**

Mutation: set `DEFAULT_SCREENSAVER_TYPE` to `ScreensaverType::STARFIELD`, rebuild, confirm `a fresh install defaults the screensaver to flying toasters on every tier` and `fresh installs default to flying toasters, a registered saver` fail; restore. Putting the tier expression back into `init_subjects` survives on a STANDARD test host, where it also yields flying toasters; the commit says so.

```bash
.venv/bin/clang-format -i include/screensaver_registry.h src/system/display_settings_manager.cpp tests/unit/test_screensaver.cpp tests/unit/test_screensaver_registry.cpp
git add -- include/screensaver_registry.h src/system/display_settings_manager.cpp tests/unit/test_screensaver.cpp tests/unit/test_screensaver_registry.cpp docs/user/CONFIGURATION.md docs/user/guide/settings/display-sound.md config/settings.json.template
git commit -m "feat(screensaver): fresh installs run flying toasters on every board with savers" -m "The default no longer depends on the platform tier: the gate measures the saver on the board and steps it down or shows a black screen when it costs too much. Stored choices, including those migration v16 turned off, are untouched. The user docs and the settings template now name the real default and the four options." -m "Mutation: DEFAULT_SCREENSAVER_TYPE set to STARFIELD; both default tests went red (the tier expression in init_subjects survives on this STANDARD test host)"
```

### Task 8: 1 GB quad-core boards are STANDARD tier

> **Landed early (2026-09-15):** the STANDARD threshold change shipped with the smoothness branch as `b336b2c90` (768 MB, 4 cores). Skip this task; verify the threshold at `include/platform_capabilities.h` and move on to Task 9.

`STANDARD_RAM_THRESHOLD_MB` drops from 2048 to 768 so a 1 GB Pi (about 856 MB reported) is STANDARD; four cores stay required. It lands only after the Pi 3B passes a UI check under the load gate with the new tier.

Behaviour this changes on boards with 768 MB to 2 GB and 4 or more cores (every caller of the tier found by `grep -rn 'supports_animations\|\.tier\b\|PlatformTier::' src include`):

1. `src/system/display_settings_manager.cpp#DisplaySettingsManager::init_subjects`: `animations_enabled` defaults to on when the user has no stored choice and the display is not software-rotated.
2. `src/ui/ui_panel_input_shaper.cpp#InputShaperPanel::create_chart_widgets` passes the tier to `src/ui/ui_frequency_response_chart.cpp#ui_frequency_response_chart_configure_for_platform`: charts hold 200 points instead of 50.
3. `src/system/config.cpp#migrate_v15_to_v16`: a config older than v16 upgraded on such a board keeps Flying Toasters instead of being switched off with a notice.
4. `src/ui/ui_keyboard_manager.cpp` logs the tier as `standard`; the keycap depth is unchanged because `src/ui/ui_keycap_style.cpp#decide_keycap_depth` treats BASIC and STANDARD alike.
5. Unchanged: the toaster sprite count and the screensaver default no longer read the tier (Tasks 6 and 7); crash reports, debug bundles and telemetry send RAM and core counts, not the tier; the log ring sizes by RAM.

**Files:**
- Modify: `include/platform_capabilities.h` (`STANDARD_RAM_THRESHOLD_MB`, the `PlatformTier` doc comments), `docs/devel/INPUT_SHAPER.md` (`### Tier Classification`, `### Platform Examples`, `### Constants`)
- Test: `tests/unit/test_platform_capabilities.cpp`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 0 `arm_measure.sh` with `SAVERS="off ui"`, `pi3b_service.sh ACTION=display_value|unset_display`.
- Produces: `PlatformCapabilities::STANDARD_RAM_THRESHOLD_MB == 768`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tier tests**

In `tests/unit/test_platform_capabilities.cpp`, replace the whole `TEST_CASE("Tier classification: boundary at exactly 2048MB", ...)` with:

```cpp
TEST_CASE("Tier classification: boundary at exactly 768MB", "[platform][tier][boundary]") {
    // 768 MB with 4 cores is STANDARD; one megabyte less is BASIC
    CHECK(PlatformCapabilities::from_metrics(768, 4, 1000.0f).tier == PlatformTier::STANDARD);
    CHECK(PlatformCapabilities::from_metrics(767, 4, 1000.0f).tier == PlatformTier::BASIC);
}

TEST_CASE("Tier classification: a 1 GB quad-core Pi is STANDARD", "[platform][tier]") {
    // A 1 GB Raspberry Pi 3B reports about 856 MB
    auto caps = PlatformCapabilities::from_metrics(856, 4, 38.0f);
    REQUIRE(caps.tier == PlatformTier::STANDARD);
    CHECK(caps.supports_animations);
    CHECK(caps.max_chart_points == 200);

    // Three cores at the same RAM stay BASIC
    CHECK(PlatformCapabilities::from_metrics(856, 3, 38.0f).tier == PlatformTier::BASIC);
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the tests and watch them fail**

Run: `make test -j"$JOBS" > "$SS_SCRATCH/test-build.log" 2>&1; echo "exit $?"` then `./build/bin/helix-tests "[platform][tier]"`.
Expected: `exit 0`; `boundary at exactly 768MB` and `a 1 GB quad-core Pi is STANDARD` fail with `BASIC == STANDARD`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Lower the threshold**

In `include/platform_capabilities.h`:

- Replace `static constexpr size_t STANDARD_RAM_THRESHOLD_MB = 2048;` with `static constexpr size_t STANDARD_RAM_THRESHOLD_MB = 768;`.
- In the `BASIC` doc comment, replace ` * - RAM 512MB-2GB OR 2-3 cores` with ` * - RAM 512-767 MB OR 2-3 cores` and ` * - Examples: Raspberry Pi 3, older Pi 4 models` with ` * - Examples: 512 MB boards, 2-3 core boards`.
- In the `STANDARD` doc comment, replace ` * - RAM >= 2GB AND 4+ cores` with ` * - RAM >= 768 MB AND 4+ cores` and ` * - Examples: Raspberry Pi 4/5 (2GB+), desktop` with ` * - Examples: Raspberry Pi 3B (1 GB) and 4/5, desktop`.

In `docs/devel/INPUT_SHAPER.md`:

- Replace `| **BASIC** | 512 MB - 2 GB or 2-3 cores | 2-3 | Yes (simplified) | 50 |` with `| **BASIC** | 512-767 MB or 2-3 cores | 2-3 | Yes (simplified) | 50 |`.
- Replace `| **STANDARD** | >=2 GB and 4+ cores | 4+ | Yes (full) | 200 |` with `| **STANDARD** | >=768 MB and 4+ cores | 4+ | Yes (full) | 200 |`.
- Replace `- **BASIC**: Raspberry Pi 3 -- chart with 50 points` with `- **BASIC**: 512 MB or 2-3 core boards -- chart with 50 points`.
- Replace `- **STANDARD**: Raspberry Pi 4/5 (2 GB+), desktop -- full chart with 200 points` with `- **STANDARD**: Raspberry Pi 3B (1 GB), Pi 4/5, desktop -- full chart with 200 points`.
- Replace `static constexpr size_t STANDARD_RAM_THRESHOLD_MB = 2048;` with `static constexpr size_t STANDARD_RAM_THRESHOLD_MB = 768;`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tier tests and the suites that read the tier**

Run: `make test -j"$JOBS" > "$SS_SCRATCH/test-build.log" 2>&1; echo "exit $?"` then `./build/bin/helix-tests "[platform]"` then `./build/bin/helix-tests "[config][migration][v16],[display_settings],[screensaver]"`.
Expected: `exit 0`; every case passes.

- [ ] **Step 5: Check the Pi 3B UI under the load gate with the new tier**

Preston approved device use this session (Task 3 Step 0)? If not, ask him first. With the Task 3 Step 0 settings exported, hold the Pi while reading, and if need be clearing, the stored choice:

```bash
. scripts/screensaver-perf/perf_env.sh
perf_pi3b_take "check the stored animations choice" || exit 1
perf_run_remote scripts/screensaver-perf/pi3b_service.sh ACTION=display_value KEY=animations_enabled
```

If it prints anything other than `null`, the Pi carries a stored choice that hides the new default: note the value, then run `perf_run_remote scripts/screensaver-perf/pi3b_service.sh ACTION=unset_display KEY=animations_enabled` so the check exercises the STANDARD default (tell Preston the stored value was removed, and restore it after the check if he wants it back).

Release the Pi, then start the arm, which claims it and checks the print state itself:

```bash
perf_pi3b_release
ARM=task8-standard BUILD=1 HELIX_PERF_BUILD_TREE="$PWD" WORKLOADS="idle" SAVERS="off ui" BASELINES="task6-gate" \
  setsid nohup scripts/screensaver-perf/arm_measure.sh > "$SS_SCRATCH/task8-standard.log" 2>&1 < /dev/null &
```

When `task8-standard.done` exists, confirm the Pi falls in the new tier: `perf_ssh 'grep MemTotal /proc/meminfo; nproc'` must show at least `786432 kB` (768 MB) and `4`. Pass criteria: both `off` and `ui` load-gate rows `PASS`, no crash lines, and the `idle` CPU total no more than 1.0 percentage point above `task6-gate`'s largest idle run. Ask Preston to look at the Pi 3B panel while the `ui` workload cycles panels (animations on) and say whether it looks smooth. A gate failure or his objection blocks the commit: stop and report the summary rows.

- [ ] **Step 6: Mutate, then commit**

Mutation: set `STANDARD_RAM_THRESHOLD_MB` back to `2048`, rebuild, confirm `Tier classification: boundary at exactly 768MB` and `Tier classification: a 1 GB quad-core Pi is STANDARD` fail; restore.

```bash
.venv/bin/clang-format -i include/platform_capabilities.h tests/unit/test_platform_capabilities.cpp
git add -- include/platform_capabilities.h tests/unit/test_platform_capabilities.cpp docs/devel/INPUT_SHAPER.md
git commit -m "feat(platform): 1 GB quad-core boards such as the Pi 3B are STANDARD tier" -m "STANDARD needs 768 MB and 4 cores. On those boards animations default on, input shaper charts hold 200 points, and a pre-v16 config upgrade keeps its screensaver; keycap depth, telemetry and the screensavers do not read the tier. The Pi 3B passed the load gate idle and cycling panels with animations on." -m "Mutation: STANDARD_RAM_THRESHOLD_MB back to 2048; the 768 MB boundary and 1 GB quad-core tests went red"
```

### Task 9: PixelWriter RGB565, ordered dither, max blending, lines; 16-bit canvas frames

Adds the RGB565 path to `PixelWriter`, a 4x4 ordered dither for fades, per-channel max blending and a Bresenham line visitor, and lets `SaverCanvas` hand out RGB565 frames. Everything is tested on plain buffers in the 32-bit host test build; the saver picks the display's format at compile time.

**Files:**
- Modify: `include/screensaver_frame.h` (`PixelFormat::RGB565`), `include/screensaver_pixel_writer.h` (rewritten), `include/screensaver_canvas.h` (`SAVER_BUILD_CANVAS_FORMAT`, `pixel_format_for`, `SaverCanvas::frame`)
- Test: `tests/unit/test_screensaver_pixel_writer.cpp` (four new cases), `tests/unit/test_screensaver_parts.cpp` (one new case), `[screensaver_fingerprint]` (unchanged)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 4 `PixelWriter`, `FrameTarget`, `Rgb`; Task 3 `SaverCanvas`.
- Produces (Task 10):
  - `enum class PixelFormat : uint8_t { XRGB8888, RGB565 };`
  - `inline constexpr uint8_t BAYER_4X4[4][4];`, `constexpr uint8_t dither_channel(uint8_t c, uint8_t max_level, uint8_t threshold);`
  - `PixelWriter::put(int32_t, int32_t, Rgb)` for both formats, `void put_dithered(int32_t x, int32_t y, Rgb c);`, `Rgb get(int32_t, int32_t) const` for both formats, `void blend_max(int32_t x, int32_t y, Rgb c);`, `template <typename Plot> static void line(int32_t x0, int32_t y0, int32_t x1, int32_t y1, Plot&& plot);`
  - `inline constexpr lv_color_format_t SAVER_BUILD_CANVAS_FORMAT;` (RGB565 when `LV_COLOR_DEPTH == 16`, else XRGB8888), `constexpr PixelFormat pixel_format_for(lv_color_format_t cf);`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing RGB565, dither, blend and line tests**

Append to `tests/unit/test_screensaver_pixel_writer.cpp`:

```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the build and watch it fail**

Run: `make test -j"$JOBS" > "$SS_SCRATCH/test-build.log" 2>&1; echo "exit $?"`
Expected: `exit 2`; the log reports `RGB565` is not a member of `helix::ui::PixelFormat`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the RGB565 writer**

In `include/screensaver_frame.h`, replace the `PixelFormat` enum with:

```cpp
/// How a FrameTarget stores its pixels.
enum class PixelFormat : uint8_t {
    /// 4 bytes per pixel: B, G, R, and an X byte of 0xFF
    XRGB8888,
    /// 2 bytes per pixel, little-endian: red in the top 5 bits, green in the middle 6, blue in the low 5
    RGB565,
};
```

In `include/screensaver_canvas.h`, directly after `namespace helix::ui {`, insert:

inline constexpr lv_color_format_t SAVER_BUILD_CANVAS_FORMAT =
    LV_COLOR_DEPTH == 16 ? LV_COLOR_FORMAT_RGB565 : LV_COLOR_FORMAT_XRGB8888;

constexpr PixelFormat pixel_format_for(lv_color_format_t cf) {
    return cf == LV_COLOR_FORMAT_RGB565 ? PixelFormat::RGB565 : PixelFormat::XRGB8888;
}

```

and replace the body of `SaverCanvas::frame()` with:

```cpp
    FrameTarget frame() const {
        return {buf_, stride_, static_cast<uint32_t>(w_), static_cast<uint32_t>(h_),
                pixel_format_for(cf_)};
    }
```

(its doc comment stays: "The buffer as a frame for direct pixel writes, for a canvas in a format PixelWriter writes.").

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests, including the unchanged fingerprints**

Run: `make test -j"$JOBS" > "$SS_SCRATCH/test-build.log" 2>&1; echo "exit $?"` then `./build/bin/helix-tests "[pixel_writer],[screensaver_parts],[starfield_sim]"` then `./build/bin/helix-tests "[screensaver_fingerprint]"`.
Expected: `exit 0`; every case passes; both fingerprints unchanged.

- [ ] **Step 5: Mutate, then commit**

Mutation: in `dither_channel`, change `(2u * threshold + 1u) * 255u` to `255u * 16u` (no dither), rebuild, confirm `PixelWriter dithers RGB565 with a 4x4 ordered pattern and writes XRGB8888 exactly` fails. Restore.

```bash
.venv/bin/clang-format -i include/screensaver_frame.h include/screensaver_pixel_writer.h include/screensaver_canvas.h tests/unit/test_screensaver_pixel_writer.cpp tests/unit/test_screensaver_parts.cpp
git add -- include/screensaver_frame.h include/screensaver_pixel_writer.h include/screensaver_canvas.h tests/unit/test_screensaver_pixel_writer.cpp tests/unit/test_screensaver_parts.cpp
git commit -m "feat(screensaver): PixelWriter writes RGB565 with ordered dither, max blending and lines" -m "PixelWriter now writes and reads RGB565 frames, dithers fades with a 4x4 Bayer pattern so 16-bit gradients do not band, raises channels to the brighter colour for overlapping light, and visits Bresenham lines. SaverCanvas frames carry the canvas format, and SAVER_BUILD_CANVAS_FORMAT picks the display's depth at compile time. Exact bits for both formats are tested on the 32-bit host." -m "Mutation: dither_channel rounded at a fixed half level; the ordered-dither pattern test went red"

### Task 10: Fireworks

A pure `FireworksSim` draws a night sky (computed per pixel, never stored), hills, rising shells and four burst kinds through `PixelWriter` into RGB565 or XRGB8888 frames, with one dirty box per rocket or burst and a spark pool fixed at start. `FireworksScreensaver` runs it on the saver base with the spec's four-level ladder. Fireworks becomes type 4 with a dropdown option, translations, CJK glyphs, ESP32 exclusions, a harness name and a developer doc.

**Files:**
- Create: `include/screensaver_fireworks_sim.h`, `src/ui/screensaver_fireworks_sim.cpp`, `include/screensaver_fireworks.h`, `src/ui/screensaver_fireworks.cpp`, `docs/devel/SCREENSAVERS.md`
- Modify: `include/screensaver_registry.h` (`ScreensaverType::FIREWORKS`, row), `include/screensaver_canvas.h` (`BUILD_SAVER_DEPTH`), `src/ui/screensaver_manager.cpp#ScreensaverManager::ScreensaverManager`, `include/display_settings_manager.h` (two type comments), `ui_xml/settings_display_sound_overlay.xml` (`row_screensaver`), `translations/*.yml` (9 files), `ui_xml/translations/*.xml` (regenerated), `assets/fonts/cjk/` (regenerated), `firmware/helixscreen-esp32/components/helixapp/app_srcs_excluded.txt`, `scripts/screensaver-perf/perf_env.sh#perf_saver_type`, `docs/devel/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md` (`HELIX_SCREENSAVER_NOW`), `docs/user/CONFIGURATION.md` (`screensaver_type`), `docs/user/guide/settings/display-sound.md`, `config/settings.json.template`, `docs/devel/CLAUDE.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/CLAUDE.md`
- Test: `tests/unit/test_screensaver_fireworks.cpp` (new), `[screensaver_registry]` (the dropdown test goes red, then green)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 9 `PixelWriter::{put_dithered, blend_max, get, contains, line}`, `FrameTarget`, `Rgb`, `SAVER_BUILD_CANVAS_FORMAT`; Task 3 `SaverBase`, `SaverTestAccess`, `SAVER_FAST_PERIOD`; Task 1 registry; Task 6 `ScreensaverManagerTestAccess::active`; `helix::ui::screensaver::{random_below, unit_random}`.
- Produces (Task 11):
  - `ScreensaverType::FIREWORKS = 5`; registry row `{FIREWORKS, "fireworks", "Fireworks", SAVER_DEPTH_16 | SAVER_DEPTH_32}`
  - `struct FireworksLevel { uint32_t period_ms; uint16_t sparks_per_burst; uint8_t trail; uint8_t bursts_at_once; };`, `inline constexpr FireworksLevel FIREWORKS_LEVELS[]`, `inline constexpr size_t FIREWORKS_LEVEL_COUNT`
  - `struct FireworksPacing { uint32_t first_launch_ms = 300; uint32_t min_gap_ms = 800; uint32_t max_gap_ms = 2500; uint32_t finale_every_ms = 180000; uint8_t finale_min_shells = 6; uint8_t finale_max_shells = 10; uint32_t finale_span_ms = 4000; };`
  - `class FireworksSim { static constexpr size_t MAX_BURSTS = 6; static constexpr int STAR_COUNT = 80; void init(FrameTarget&, std::minstd_rand&, size_t level, const FireworksPacing& = {}); void step(uint32_t dt_ms, FrameTarget&, std::minstd_rand&, std::vector<DirtyRect>& dirty); void request_level(size_t); size_t level() const; size_t spark_capacity() const; size_t sparks_in_use() const; void clear(); Rgb sky_at(int32_t x, int32_t y) const; };`
  - `class FireworksScreensaver : public helix::ui::SaverBase`
  - `inline constexpr uint8_t helix::ui::BUILD_SAVER_DEPTH;`
  - Harness: `perf_saver_type fireworks` prints `4`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing fireworks tests**

```

In `include/screensaver_registry.h`, add `FIREWORKS = 5,` after `BOUNCING_PRINTER = 4,` in `ScreensaverType`, and add this row after the bounce row of `SCREENSAVERS`:

```cpp
    {ScreensaverType::FIREWORKS, "fireworks", "Fireworks", SAVER_DEPTH_16 | SAVER_DEPTH_32},
```

In `include/screensaver_canvas.h`, add `#include "screensaver_registry.h"` next to `#include "screensaver_frame.h"`, and insert after `pixel_format_for`:

```cpp
/// SaverDepth bit of this build's display.
inline constexpr uint8_t BUILD_SAVER_DEPTH = LV_COLOR_DEPTH == 16 ? SAVER_DEPTH_16 : SAVER_DEPTH_32;

```

In `src/ui/screensaver_manager.cpp`, add `#include "screensaver_fireworks.h"` to the includes and append to the constructor body, after the pipes line:

```cpp
    screensavers_.push_back(std::make_unique<FireworksScreensaver>());
```

In `include/display_settings_manager.h`, replace `/** @brief Get screensaver type (0=Off, 1=Flying Toasters, 2=Starfield, 3=3D Pipes) */` with `/** @brief Get screensaver type (a ScreensaverType value, include/screensaver_registry.h) */`, and `/** @brief Screensaver type subject (integer: 0=off, 1=toasters, 2=starfield, 3=pipes) */` with `/** @brief Screensaver type subject (a ScreensaverType value, include/screensaver_registry.h) */`.

In `firmware/helixscreen-esp32/components/helixapp/app_srcs_excluded.txt`, add after `src/ui/screensaver_cpu_clock.cpp  # not in the v1 Core+AMS cut`:

```
src/ui/screensaver_fireworks.cpp  # not in the v1 Core+AMS cut
src/ui/screensaver_fireworks_sim.cpp  # not in the v1 Core+AMS cut
```

In `scripts/screensaver-perf/perf_env.sh#perf_saver_type`, add `    fireworks) echo 4 ;;` after the `pipes) echo 3 ;;` line.

- [ ] **Step 7: Run the tests and watch the dropdown test fail**

Run: `python3 scripts/check_esp32_app_srcs.py; echo "exit $?"` then `make test -j"$JOBS" > "$SS_SCRATCH/test-build.log" 2>&1; echo "exit $?"` then `./build/bin/helix-tests "[fireworks_sim],[screensaver_fireworks]"` then `./build/bin/helix-tests "[screensaver_registry]"`.
Expected: `exit 0` twice; every fireworks case passes; `the settings dropdown lists Off then every registered screensaver in type order` fails because the XML lacks `Fireworks`.

- [ ] **Step 8: Add the dropdown option, translations and CJK glyphs**

In `ui_xml/settings_display_sound_overlay.xml`, in `row_screensaver`, change both `options="Off&#10;Flying Toasters&#10;Starfield&#10;3D Pipes"` and `options_tag="Off&#10;Flying Toasters&#10;Starfield&#10;3D Pipes"` to end in `&#10;3D Pipes&#10;Fireworks"`.

Run `make translation-sync > "$SS_SCRATCH/translation-sync.log" 2>&1; echo "exit $?"`, then check what it wrote. English gets the key as its value and every other language an empty string (`scripts/translations/yaml_manager.py#merge_new_keys`):

```bash
grep -c -x -F "  Fireworks: Fireworks" translations/en.yml
for lang in de es fr it ja pt ru zh; do printf '%s: ' "$lang"; grep -c -x -F "  Fireworks: ''" "translations/$lang.yml"; done
```

Expected: `exit 0`, or a non-zero exit whose log ends with the CJK staleness check naming the new characters (fixed below); `1` for `en.yml` and `1` for each of the eight others. A `0` means the sync wrote the entry in another form: stop and read that file rather than editing it blind.

Set the translations, matching the empty value, then check every file holds its exact text:

```bash
sed -i "s/^  Fireworks: ''\$/  Fireworks: Feuerwerk/" translations/de.yml
sed -i "s/^  Fireworks: ''\$/  Fireworks: Fuegos artificiales/" translations/es.yml
sed -i "s/^  Fireworks: ''\$/  Fireworks: Feux d'artifice/" translations/fr.yml
sed -i "s/^  Fireworks: ''\$/  Fireworks: Fuochi d'artificio/" translations/it.yml
sed -i "s/^  Fireworks: ''\$/  Fireworks: 花火/" translations/ja.yml
sed -i "s/^  Fireworks: ''\$/  Fireworks: Fogos de artifício/" translations/pt.yml
sed -i "s/^  Fireworks: ''\$/  Fireworks: Фейерверк/" translations/ru.yml
sed -i "s/^  Fireworks: ''\$/  Fireworks: 烟花/" translations/zh.yml
missing=0
while IFS='|' read -r lang text; do
    grep -q -x -F "  Fireworks: $text" "translations/$lang.yml" || { echo "MISSING $lang: $text"; missing=1; }
done <<'EOF'
en|Fireworks
de|Feuerwerk
es|Fuegos artificiales
fr|Feux d'artifice
it|Fuochi d'artificio
ja|花火
pt|Fogos de artifício
ru|Фейерверк
zh|烟花
EOF
echo "missing=$missing"
```

Expected: `missing=0` and no `MISSING` line; `sed` exits 0 whether or not it matched, so this check is what proves the values landed, and with them the CJK characters the font step below must add.

Regenerate the packs and the CJK runtime fonts, then check them:

```bash
make translations > "$SS_SCRATCH/translations.log" 2>&1; echo "exit $?"
make regen-text-fonts > "$SS_SCRATCH/regen-text-fonts.log" 2>&1; echo "exit $?"
bash scripts/check_cjk_font_staleness.sh && python3 scripts/check_cjk_font_coverage.py; echo "cjk exit $?"
git status --short translations ui_xml/translations assets/fonts/cjk
```

Expected: both makes `exit 0` (`regen-text-fonts` downloads the Noto CJK sources when absent and needs `lv_font_conv` from `node_modules`); `cjk exit 0`; the status lists the nine YAML files, the regenerated `ui_xml/translations/*.xml` packs and at least one changed file under `assets/fonts/cjk/` (none there means the new 花火 and 烟花 glyphs were not baked: stop).

Run: `./build/bin/helix-tests "[screensaver_registry]"`
Expected: every case passes.

- [ ] **Step 9: Update the docs**

In `docs/devel/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md` (section `HELIX_SCREENSAVER_NOW`), change the **Values** row's name list from `(\`toasters\`, \`starfield\`, \`pipes\`)` to `(\`toasters\`, \`starfield\`, \`pipes\`, \`fireworks\`)`.

In `docs/user/CONFIGURATION.md` (section `screensaver_type`), replace `**Values:** \`0\` = Off, \`1\` = Flying Toasters, \`2\` = Starfield, \`3\` = 3D Pipes` with `**Values:** \`0\` = Off, \`1\` = Flying Toasters, \`2\` = Starfield, \`3\` = 3D Pipes, \`4\` = Fireworks`.

In `docs/user/guide/settings/display-sound.md`, add this row after the `**3D Pipes**` row of the screensaver table:

```markdown
| **Fireworks** | Fireworks bursting over hills under a night sky |
```

In `config/settings.json.template`, change `3=3D Pipes. Replaces` in `_screensaver_type_comment` to `3=3D Pipes, 4=Fireworks. Replaces`, then run `python3 -c 'import json; json.load(open("config/settings.json.template")); print("template ok")'` (expected `template ok`).

Create `docs/devel/SCREENSAVERS.md`:

# Screensavers

A screensaver runs when the display dims (`DisplayManager::check_display_sleep`), covers the
panel with a full-screen overlay, and measures its own CPU cost so it never slows the printer.
This doc is the map: which file owns what, how the gate decides, and how to add a saver.

## Key files

| File | Owns |
|---|---|
| `include/screensaver_registry.h` | `ScreensaverType`, the `SCREENSAVERS` rows (type, stable name, label key, color depths), clamp, `HELIX_SCREENSAVER_NOW` names, the fresh-install default. Always compiled |
| `include/screensaver_base.h` | `SaverBase`: start, frame and stop sequence, levels, level requests |
| `include/screensaver_overlay.h` | `SaverOverlay`: the black touch-absorbing overlay on `lv_layer_top()` |
| `include/screensaver_canvas.h` | `SaverCanvas`: stride-sized buffer, format per depth, hide-before-free, dirty areas merged to 32, the dirty-box layer session |
| `include/screensaver_frame_timer.h` | `SaverFrameTimer`: frame timer with a `MotionClock`, period changes without a motion jump |
| `include/refresh_period_hold.h` | The display refresh while a saver runs, at the saver's current period; `period()` holds `HELIX_SCREENSAVER_REFR_PERIOD_MS` |
| `include/screensaver_frame.h`, `include/screensaver_pixel_writer.h` | `DirtyRect`, `FrameTarget`, `PixelWriter` (RGB565 and XRGB8888, ordered dither, max blend, lines). No LVGL |
| `include/screensaver_gate.h`, `include/screensaver_cpu_clock.h` | Budget, decision, idle baseline, windows, environment switches, the CPU clock seam |
| `include/screensaver_level_store.h` | Board fingerprint and the stored level per saver |
| `include/screensaver.h`, `src/ui/screensaver_manager.cpp` | `ScreensaverManager`: factories, holds, the gate, the black-screen fallback |
| `include/ui_screensaver.h`, `include/screensaver_starfield.h`, `include/screensaver_pipes.h`, `include/screensaver_fireworks.h` | The savers |
| `scripts/screensaver-perf/` | Measuring a saver on a real board |

## The foundation

Every saver derives from `SaverBase` and implements `canvas_format()`, `on_start()`,
`on_frame()`, `on_stop()` and its ladder (`ladder_size()`, `ladder_period_ms()`). The base
creates the overlay, the canvas when the saver has one, seeds the saver's own random sequence,
starts the frame timer at the level's period, and invalidates the dirty areas each frame
returns. A saver that writes pixels itself returns boxes; a saver drawing with `lv_draw_*`
opens `SaverCanvas::begin_layer()`, marks what it draws with `mark_dirty()` and finishes with
`finish_layer()`. Toasters use no canvas: their sprites are LVGL images.

Every ladder starts at 16 ms (`SAVER_FAST_PERIOD`, one refresh of a 60 Hz panel), or at
`HELIX_SCREENSAVER_REFR_PERIOD_MS` when that is set for manual testing
(`SaverBase::level_period_ms`); levels 1 and up keep their declared periods either way. Starfield
and pipes then run at 33 ms; toasters at 33 ms with every sprite, then 33 ms with ten; fireworks
per `FIREWORKS_LEVELS`. While a saver runs, `helix::RefreshPeriodHold` refreshes the display at
the saver's current period (`follow`), so the display and the saver stay equal at every level. Device measurements assume the pacing that keeps 16 ms even: EGL vsync and a 1 ms
main-loop floor, which every device run sets explicitly (`scripts/screensaver-perf/arm_measure.sh`).

Motion is a function of elapsed time (`include/screensaver_motion.h`), so a level that changes
the frame period changes nothing on screen but the frame rate, and at the toasters' lowest rung
the sprite count.

## The gate

`ScreensaverManager::on_idle_check_tick` runs on the display manager's idle-check tick and
samples `CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID` (every thread, LVGL's draw thread included) at most every
250 ms.

- While no saver runs, samples feed `IdleBaseline`: the CPU rate over the last idle stretch of
  up to 10 s, and 0 under 3 s of samples.
- A run ignores its first second, then closes a 5 s window after another for as long as it runs:
  `(cpu delta - baseline * wall) / wall` as a share of one core.
- The budget is `saver_budget_share`: 4 or more cores 50%, 3 cores 37%, 2 cores 25%, 1 core 10%,
  halved while `SaverHost::is_printing` says a print holds the machine.
- `decide_saver_level`: within budget the level stays (a run never steps up); over budget the
  saver steps down one level at its next natural break; over budget at the bottom level the run
  becomes a static black `SaverOverlay` with no frame timer.

Each step down and each too-heavy mark is stored at `/display/screensaver_levels/<name>` as
`{"level", "too_heavy", "version", "board"}`. The next run of that saver starts there, unless
`helix_version_full()` or the board fingerprint (display path, cores, bogomips to the nearest
100, resolution, color depth) differs, which starts again at level 0.

`HELIX_SCREENSAVER_BUDGET_PCT` replaces the budget and `HELIX_SCREENSAVER_LEVEL` forces a level
with the gate off (`docs/devel/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md`).

## Color depth and builds

The registry row lists the depths a saver draws at. Toasters, starfield and pipes are 32 bpp
only; fireworks draws RGB565 or XRGB8888 through `PixelWriter`, with `SAVER_BUILD_CANVAS_FORMAT`
picking the display's depth at compile time.

## Adding a saver

1. Add the type to `ScreensaverType` and a row to `SCREENSAVERS` with a stable name and depths.
2. Add the label to `row_screensaver` in `ui_xml/settings_display_sound_overlay.xml` (a test
   compares it with the registry), run `make translation-sync`, translate the new key in every
   `translations/*.yml`, then `make translations` (and `make regen-text-fonts` for new CJK text).
3. Derive from `SaverBase` in `include/screensaver_<name>.h` and `src/ui/screensaver_<name>.cpp`;
   keep the scene in a pure simulation class when it writes pixels, so it is testable without a
   display. Register the factory in `ScreensaverManager::ScreensaverManager`.
4. Add the new sources to `firmware/helixscreen-esp32/components/helixapp/app_srcs_excluded.txt`
   (the Makefile screensaver filter picks up `src/ui/screensaver_*.cpp` by itself).
5. Test determinism per seed, that dirty areas cover every changed pixel, and the ladder, then
   measure the saver on a board with `scripts/screensaver-perf/`.
````

In `docs/devel/CLAUDE.md`, add this row directly after the `SOUND_SYSTEM.md` row of the Feature Systems table:

```markdown
| `SCREENSAVERS.md` | Screensavers: the registry, shared overlay/canvas/timer/pixel writer, the CPU gate and stored levels, color depth in builds, adding a saver |
```

In `docs/README.md`, add this row directly after the `[**Sound System**](devel/SOUND_SYSTEM.md)` row:

```markdown
| [**Screensavers**](devel/SCREENSAVERS.md) | Registry, shared parts, CPU gate and stored levels, adding a saver |
```

In `docs/CLAUDE.md`, add this row to the Quick Routing table directly after `| Understand modal patterns | \`devel/MODAL_SYSTEM.md\` |`:

```markdown
| Work on a screensaver | `devel/SCREENSAVERS.md` |
```

Run: `python3 scripts/check_doc_refs.py; echo "exit $?"`
Expected: `exit 0`.

- [ ] **Step 10: Run everything fireworks touches and look at it**

Run: `make test -j"$JOBS" > "$SS_SCRATCH/test-build.log" 2>&1; echo "exit $?"` then `./build/bin/helix-tests "[screensaver]"` then `make -j"$JOBS" > "$SS_SCRATCH/app-build.log" 2>&1; echo "exit $?"`.
Expected: `exit 0`; every `[screensaver]` case passes; the app builds.

Then run it locally and capture a frame:

```bash
TREE=$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)")
export HELIX_SOCK="/tmp/helix-$TREE.sock" HELIX_CONFIG_DIR="/tmp/helix-config-$TREE"
mkdir -p "$HELIX_CONFIG_DIR"
SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy HELIX_SCREENSAVER_NOW=fireworks ./build/bin/helix-screen --test -vv \
  --remote-socket "$HELIX_SOCK" > "$SS_SCRATCH/mock-fireworks.log" 2>&1 &
MOCK_PID=$!
```

When `grep -c 'Type 4 running at level 0' "$SS_SCRATCH/mock-fireworks.log"` prints `1`, wait until the log is at least 4 s older than that line (a Monitor until-loop on the log's timestamps), then run `./build/bin/helix-screen ctl -s "$HELIX_SOCK" screenshot "$SS_SCRATCH/fireworks.png"` and `kill "$MOCK_PID"`. Show Preston `$SS_SCRATCH/fireworks.png` as an artifact or file path (he cannot see images read into this session) and ask whether the sky, hills, shells and bursts look right. Delete `$HELIX_CONFIG_DIR`.

- [ ] **Step 11: Mutate, then commit**

Mutation: in `FireworksSim::erase_point`, delete `box.add(x, y, x, y);`, rebuild, and confirm `every pixel a fireworks frame changes lies in one of its dirty boxes` fails. Restore.

### Task 11: 16 bpp measurement builds, device verification and completion gates

Builds that do not ship screensavers get a way to compile only the 16-bit-capable savers, so the CC1 and AD5M can answer whether a screensaver fits at all. Then fireworks is measured per level on the Pi 3B, the CC1 and the AD5M under the load gate, with Preston approving each printer and judging the looks. The branch closes with the full suite, mutation, ASAN and removal of the plan documents.

**How a 16 bpp build leaves out the 32-bit savers:** `Makefile` lists the platform targets whose `lv_conf.h` sets `LV_COLOR_DEPTH 16` in `SCREENSAVER_16BPP_TARGETS` and filters `SCREENSAVER_32BPP_ONLY_SRCS` (toasters, starfield and its simulation, pipes) out of `APP_SRCS` for them. `src/ui/screensaver_manager.cpp` creates those three savers only under `#if LV_COLOR_DEPTH == 32`. The two lists cannot drift silently: a 16 bpp target missing from the Makefile list compiles the 32-bit sources and stops on their `static_assert(LV_COLOR_DEPTH == 32)`, and a 32 bpp target wrongly in it fails to link the manager.

**What the dropdown shows on those builds:** all five options (`Off`, `Flying Toasters`, `Starfield`, `3D Pipes`, `Fireworks`), because `ui_xml/settings_display_sound_overlay.xml` is shared. Choosing a 32-bit saver logs `No screensaver registered for type N` and no saver starts; the screen dims and sleeps as it does with no saver. These builds are measurement builds and are never shipped.

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/devel/SCREENSAVERS.md` (`## Color depth and builds`), `Makefile` (16 bpp filter), `mk/cross.mk` (`DOCKER_SCREENSAVER`, the `ad5m-docker` and `cc1-docker` recipes), `src/ui/screensaver_manager.cpp` (factories and includes under `LV_COLOR_DEPTH == 32`), `src/ui/ui_screensaver.cpp` (`static_assert`)
- Delete at ship: `docs/devel/plans/2026-09-14-screensaver-gating-fireworks-design.md`, `docs/devel/plans/2026-09-14-screensaver-gating-fireworks.md`
- Test: CC1 Docker build and binary strings, `[screensaver]`, device runs

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 0 harness (`arm_measure.sh`, `pi3b_service.sh`, `pi3b_measure.sh`, `embedded_gate.sh`, `wakeup_probe.c`, `summarize.py`), Task 10 fireworks, `scripts/device-env-set.sh <ssh-target> <env-file> <KEY> <VALUE>`, `make cc1-docker`, `make deploy-cc1 CC1_HOST=...`, `make ad5m-docker`, `make deploy-ad5m AD5M_HOST=...`, `scripts/device-profile.sh`, Task 0 `perf_app_log`, `perf_pi3b_take`, `perf_pi3b_release`, `PERF_PACING_ENV`.
- Produces: make variables `SCREENSAVER_16BPP_TARGETS`, `SCREENSAVER_32BPP_ONLY_SRCS`, `DOCKER_SCREENSAVER`; measurement results under `$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/results/`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Compile only 16-bit-capable savers on 16 bpp targets**

In `Makefile`, replace the block Task 3 wrote

```make
# Screensaver sources: every saver, the parts they share and the manager
SCREENSAVER_SRCS := $(SRC_DIR)/ui/ui_screensaver.cpp $(wildcard $(SRC_DIR)/ui/screensaver_*.cpp)
# Exclude screensaver when not enabled
ifneq ($(ENABLE_SCREENSAVER),yes)
    APP_SRCS := $(filter-out $(SCREENSAVER_SRCS),$(APP_SRCS))
endif
```

with

```make
# Screensaver sources: every saver, the parts they share and the manager
SCREENSAVER_SRCS := $(SRC_DIR)/ui/ui_screensaver.cpp $(wildcard $(SRC_DIR)/ui/screensaver_*.cpp)
# Targets whose lv_conf.h LV_COLOR_DEPTH is 16. The savers below static_assert 32 bpp, so a

SCREENSAVER_16BPP_TARGETS := ad5m ad5m-br cc1 mips k1 k1-dynamic ad5x k2 snapmaker-u1
# Savers that draw only at 32 bpp; ScreensaverManager registers them under LV_COLOR_DEPTH == 32.
SCREENSAVER_32BPP_ONLY_SRCS := $(SRC_DIR)/ui/ui_screensaver.cpp \
    $(SRC_DIR)/ui/screensaver_starfield.cpp $(SRC_DIR)/ui/screensaver_starfield_sim.cpp \
    $(SRC_DIR)/ui/screensaver_pipes.cpp
ifneq ($(ENABLE_SCREENSAVER),yes)
    APP_SRCS := $(filter-out $(SCREENSAVER_SRCS),$(APP_SRCS))

    APP_SRCS := $(filter-out $(SCREENSAVER_32BPP_ONLY_SRCS),$(APP_SRCS))
endif
```

In `src/ui/screensaver_manager.cpp`, replace the three includes `#include "ui_screensaver.h"`, `#include "screensaver_pipes.h"` and `#include "screensaver_starfield.h"` with this block placed after `#include "screensaver.h"`:

```cpp
#if LV_COLOR_DEPTH == 32
#include "screensaver_pipes.h"
#include "screensaver_starfield.h"
#include "ui_screensaver.h"
#endif
```

and replace the constructor with:

```cpp
ScreensaverManager::ScreensaverManager() : cpu_clock_(helix::ui::read_process_cpu_clock) {
#if LV_COLOR_DEPTH == 32
    // These draw at 32 bpp only; a 16 bpp build compiles and registers fireworks alone.
    screensavers_.push_back(std::make_unique<FlyingToasterScreensaver>());
    screensavers_.push_back(std::make_unique<StarfieldScreensaver>());
    screensavers_.push_back(std::make_unique<PipesScreensaver>());
#endif
    screensavers_.push_back(std::make_unique<FireworksScreensaver>());
}
```

In `src/ui/ui_screensaver.cpp`, directly after `using helix::ui::DirtyRect;`, insert:

```cpp

// The sprites are decoded for and tuned on a 32 bpp display; 16 bpp builds leave this saver out
// (Makefile SCREENSAVER_32BPP_ONLY_SRCS).
static_assert(LV_COLOR_DEPTH == 32, "flying toasters draw on a 32 bpp display");
```

In `mk/cross.mk`, directly after the `DOCKER_REMOTE_CONTROL = ...` line, insert:

```make

# Forwards ENABLE_SCREENSAVER into a Docker build when it was given on the command line, for
# measurement builds on boards that do not ship screensavers.
DOCKER_SCREENSAVER = $(if $(filter command line,$(origin ENABLE_SCREENSAVER)),ENABLE_SCREENSAVER=$(ENABLE_SCREENSAVER))
```

and in the `ad5m-docker` and `cc1-docker` recipes change `make PLATFORM_TARGET=ad5m SKIP_OPTIONAL_DEPS=1 $(DOCKER_REMOTE_CONTROL) $(DOCKER_DIAG_UPLOADS) -j$(NPROC_DOCKER_RUN)` and `make PLATFORM_TARGET=cc1 SKIP_OPTIONAL_DEPS=1 $(DOCKER_REMOTE_CONTROL) $(DOCKER_DIAG_UPLOADS) -j$(NPROC_DOCKER_RUN)` to end in `$(DOCKER_REMOTE_CONTROL) $(DOCKER_DIAG_UPLOADS) $(DOCKER_SCREENSAVER) -j$(NPROC_DOCKER_RUN)`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Prove the CC1 measurement build carries fireworks and nothing else**

```bash
pgrep -x -d' ' 'make|cc1plus'
make cc1-docker ENABLE_SCREENSAVER=yes NPROC_DOCKER_RUN="$JOBS" > "$SS_SCRATCH/cc1-docker.log" 2>&1; echo "exit $?"
for s in 'Starting fireworks' 'Starting flying toasters' 'Starting starfield' 'Starting 3D pipes' 'list_callbacks'; do
  printf '%s: ' "$s"; strings -a build/cc1/bin/helix-screen | grep -c "$s"
done
```

Expected: `exit 0`; `Starting fireworks: 1`, the three other savers `0`, `list_callbacks` at least `1` (the control server is compiled in). Then prove the host build still registers all four: `make test -j"$JOBS" > "$SS_SCRATCH/test-build.log" 2>&1; echo "exit $?"` and `./build/bin/helix-tests "[screensaver]"` (every case passes, including `every registered saver this build draws starts from the manager`).

Mutation (by hand, not reverted by make): remove `cc1` from `SCREENSAVER_16BPP_TARGETS`, rerun the Docker build, confirm it stops on a 32 bpp `static_assert` (whichever 32-bit-only saver the build reaches first); restore `cc1`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Document the build switch, then commit it**

In `docs/devel/SCREENSAVERS.md`, section `## Color depth and builds`, replace `picking the display's depth at compile time.` with:

```markdown
picking the display's depth at compile time. A 16 bpp build with `ENABLE_SCREENSAVER=yes`
compiles only the savers that draw at 16 bpp (Makefile `SCREENSAVER_32BPP_ONLY_SRCS`); the
settings dropdown still lists every row, and choosing one that is not compiled starts nothing.
```

```bash
.venv/bin/clang-format -i src/ui/screensaver_manager.cpp src/ui/ui_screensaver.cpp
git add -- Makefile mk/cross.mk src/ui/screensaver_manager.cpp src/ui/ui_screensaver.cpp docs/devel/SCREENSAVERS.md
git commit -m "build(screensaver): 16 bpp builds compile only the savers that draw at 16 bpp" -m "With ENABLE_SCREENSAVER=yes a 16 bpp target leaves toasters, starfield and pipes out of the sources and the manager, keeping fireworks, and the ad5m and cc1 Docker builds pass the switch through. This is for measurement builds on the CC1 and AD5M, which do not ship screensavers." -m "Mutation: cc1 dropped from SCREENSAVER_16BPP_TARGETS; the CC1 Docker build stopped on a 32 bpp static_assert"
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Measure fireworks per level on the Pi 3B under the load gate**

Preston approved device use this session (Task 3 Step 0)? If not, ask him first. With the Task 3 Step 0 settings, run one arm per level. Level 0 runs at 16 ms by itself, so no refresh override is set; each arm claims `device:pi3b`, checks the print state and runs with `HELIX_EGL_VSYNC=1 HELIX_LOOP_MIN_SLEEP_MS=1`. Wait for each `.done` before the next:

```bash
ARM=fireworks-l0 BUILD=1 HELIX_PERF_BUILD_TREE="$PWD" ENV_EXTRA="HELIX_SCREENSAVER_LEVEL=0" \
  WORKLOADS="idle fireworks" SAVERS="off fireworks" \
  setsid nohup scripts/screensaver-perf/arm_measure.sh > "$SS_SCRATCH/fireworks-l0.log" 2>&1 < /dev/null &
```

Then, reusing the binaries, `fireworks-l1`, `fireworks-l2` and `fireworks-l3` with `BUILD=0 BIN_FROM=fireworks-l0` and `ENV_EXTRA="HELIX_SCREENSAVER_LEVEL=1"`, `2` and `3`, and finally a gated arm `fireworks-gated` with `BUILD=0 BIN_FROM=fireworks-l0 ENV_EXTRA=""` after clearing the stored levels with the Pi held: `perf_pi3b_take "clear stored saver levels" && perf_run_remote scripts/screensaver-perf/pi3b_service.sh ACTION=unset_display KEY=screensaver_levels; perf_pi3b_release`. Summarize them together:

```bash
python3 scripts/screensaver-perf/summarize.py "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH"/results/fireworks-*.txt > "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/fireworks_pi3b_summary.txt"
. scripts/screensaver-perf/perf_env.sh
perf_pi3b_take "read stored saver levels" || exit 1
perf_run_remote scripts/screensaver-perf/pi3b_service.sh ACTION=display_value KEY=screensaver_levels
cores=$(perf_ssh 'grep -c ^processor /proc/cpuinfo')
perf_pi3b_release
echo "cores: $cores"
```

The design has the load gate confirm or correct the budget, so compare every level's cost with it. Save as `$SS_SCRATCH/budget_vs_gate.py` (used again on the CC1 and the AD5M):

```python
"""Compares each fireworks level's net CPU with the gate budget and the load-gate verdict.

usage: budget_vs_gate.py pi <cores> <results/fireworks-l0.txt> ... <results/fireworks-l3.txt>
       budget_vs_gate.py embedded <cores> <arm> <results/<arm>.txt>

Net CPU is the fireworks workload minus the idle one, as a percent of one core: the pass CPU
lines on the Pi, the helix_cpu of the gate runs on a BusyBox board. The budget is
helix::ui::saver_budget_share for a board that is not printing.
"""

sys.path.insert(0, "scripts/screensaver-perf")

mode, cores = sys.argv[1], int(sys.argv[2])
rows = []
if mode == "pi":

        arm = f"fireworks-l{level}"
        net = mean(cpu[(arm, "fireworks")]["total"]) - mean(cpu[(arm, "idle")]["total"])

        print(f"level {level}: no CPU figures")
        continue
    verdict = "FAIL"

        verdict = "PASS easily" if passes_easily(runs) else "PASS"
    side = "within" if net <= limit else "over"
    print(f"level {level}: net CPU {net:.1f}%, {side} budget, gate {verdict}")
    if side == "within" and verdict == "FAIL":
        print(f"FLAG level {level}: within the budget but fails the load gate; the budget is too generous here")
    if side == "over" and verdict == "PASS easily":
        print(f"FLAG level {level}: over the budget yet passes the load gate easily; the budget is too strict here")
```

```bash
python3 "$SS_SCRATCH/budget_vs_gate.py" pi "$cores" "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH"/results/fireworks-l[0-3].txt | tee "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/fireworks_pi3b_budget.txt"
```

Expected: `cores=4 budget=50% of a core` and one line per level. A `FLAG` line is evidence for Step 9, not a failure of this step.

Pass criteria: no crash lines in any arm log; `APP_ENV ok` in every arm log; every load-gate row `PASS`; `fireworks-l0` fireworks mean fps at least 57.0 (the 16 ms arms of 2026-09-14 presented 58.6); the gated arm's stored `fireworks` entry (if any) names the level the gate settled on. Put the per-level CPU, fps and gate verdict table, `fireworks_pi3b_budget.txt` with any `FLAG` lines, and each arm's hottest `THERMAL` reading and throttled count in the report to Preston. If level 0 fails the gate or misses 57 fps, stop and report the rows before touching the CC1.

Afterwards clear what the gated arm stored, holding the Pi: `perf_pi3b_take "clear stored saver levels" && perf_run_remote scripts/screensaver-perf/pi3b_service.sh ACTION=unset_display KEY=screensaver_levels; perf_pi3b_release` (each arm already removed its drop-in).

- [ ] **Step 5: Preston's eye check on the Pi 3B**

Tell Preston: "Fireworks is about to run on the Pi 3B panel at level 0 for 35 seconds; please watch it: shells should rise from the hills with a short trail, burst as even balls, trailing chrysanthemums, drooping gold willows and tilted rings, fade through orange with a flicker, and the screen should never flash or tear." Then, holding the Pi:

```bash
. scripts/screensaver-perf/perf_env.sh
perf_pi3b_take "fireworks eye check" || exit 1
perf_run_remote scripts/screensaver-perf/pi3b_service.sh ACTION=dropin "ENV_EXTRA=$PERF_PACING_ENV HELIX_SCREENSAVER_LEVEL=0"
perf_run_remote scripts/screensaver-perf/pi3b_service.sh ACTION=stop
perf_run_remote scripts/screensaver-perf/pi3b_service.sh ACTION=start
perf_run_remote scripts/screensaver-perf/pi3b_measure.sh TYPE=4
```

Record his verdict, then put the Pi back and release it:

```bash
perf_run_remote scripts/screensaver-perf/pi3b_service.sh ACTION=dropin ENV_EXTRA=
perf_run_remote scripts/screensaver-perf/pi3b_service.sh ACTION=stop
perf_run_remote scripts/screensaver-perf/pi3b_service.sh ACTION=start
perf_pi3b_release
```

- [ ] **Step 6: CC1 checkpoint: ask Preston before stressing it**

Ask Preston, with the facts he needs to decide: "I want to run fireworks measurements on the CC1 at <address>: deploy a measurement build (ENABLE_SCREENSAVER=yes, fireworks only), then for about 20 minutes run busy loops on half its cores plus a 1 ms wake-up probe, at the idle panel and at each fireworks level. It must not be printing. OK to go ahead?" Do nothing on the CC1 until he says yes. Then:

```bash
scripts/helix-claim check device:cc1 && scripts/helix-claim take device:cc1 "fireworks measurement" --note "measurement build, busy loops and wake-up probe"
export HELIX_PERF_HOST=<CC1 address from the device roster> HELIX_PERF_USER=root HELIX_PERF_INSTALL=/user-resource/helixscreen
unset HELIX_PERF_PASSWORD   # key auth
curl -s "http://$HELIX_PERF_HOST:80/printer/objects/query?print_stats=state"
```

Expected: the claim succeeds; the Moonraker reply's `print_stats.state` is not `printing` or `paused` (the CC1's Moonraker answers on port 80). If it is, stop and tell Preston.

- [ ] **Step 7: Measure the CC1**

Record what is installed and snapshot it on the host before anything is deployed. The snapshot is the whole install but `config` and `logs`: the XML and assets load at runtime, so they must go back with the binary they belong to.

```bash
. scripts/screensaver-perf/perf_env.sh
ENV_FILE=$HELIX_PERF_INSTALL/config/helixscreen.env
perf_ssh "$HELIX_PERF_INSTALL/bin/helix-screen --version 2>&1 | head -n 1" > "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/cc1-version-before.txt"
cat "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/cc1-version-before.txt"
perf_ssh "cd $HELIX_PERF_INSTALL && tar -cf - \$(ls -A | grep -v -x -E 'config|logs')" > "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/cc1-install-before.tar"; echo "snapshot exit $?"
tar -tf "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/cc1-install-before.tar" | grep -c -x 'bin/helix-screen'
perf_ssh "cat $ENV_FILE" > "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/cc1-env-before.txt"; echo "env exit $?"
```

Expected: a version line, `snapshot exit 0`, `1` and `env exit 0`. Anything else: stop before deploying and tell Preston.

Deploy the measurement build and build the probe:

```bash
make deploy-cc1 CC1_HOST="$HELIX_PERF_HOST" CC1_DEPLOY_DIR="$HELIX_PERF_INSTALL" > "$SS_SCRATCH/deploy-cc1.log" 2>&1; echo "exit $?"
mkdir -p build/screensaver-perf
docker run --rm --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v "$PWD":/src -w /src helixscreen/toolchain-cc1 \
  arm-none-linux-gnueabihf-gcc -std=c99 -O2 -static \
  -o build/screensaver-perf/wakeup_probe-armv7 scripts/screensaver-perf/wakeup_probe.c -lrt; echo "probe exit $?"
restart_cc1() { perf_ssh "/etc/init.d/helixscreen stop; /etc/init.d/helixscreen start"; }
export HELIX_PERF_PROBE=build/screensaver-perf/wakeup_probe-armv7 DUR=60
```

Expected: `exit 0` and `probe exit 0`.

Set the pacing switches every device run uses (EGL vsync does nothing on fbdev, and is set with the floor so every board runs the same switches) and the log level, then restart:

```bash
scripts/device-env-set.sh "root@$HELIX_PERF_HOST" "$ENV_FILE" HELIX_EGL_VSYNC 1
scripts/device-env-set.sh "root@$HELIX_PERF_HOST" "$ENV_FILE" HELIX_LOOP_MIN_SLEEP_MS 1
scripts/device-env-set.sh "root@$HELIX_PERF_HOST" "$ENV_FILE" HELIX_LOG_LEVEL info
restart_cc1
```

Wait with a Monitor until-loop on `perf_ssh 'pidof helix-screen'` printing a pid (60 s at most), then check the app carries the switches and find its log from the file it holds open rather than assuming a path:

```bash
perf_ssh 'tr "\000" "\n" < /proc/$(pidof helix-screen | cut -d" " -f1)/environ | grep -E "^HELIX_(EGL_VSYNC|LOOP_MIN_SLEEP_MS)="'
LOG=$(perf_app_log); echo "log: ${LOG:-none}"
perf_ssh "tail -n 3 $LOG"
```

Expected: `HELIX_EGL_VSYNC=1` and `HELIX_LOOP_MIN_SLEEP_MS=1`; a log path (`docs/devel/LOGGING.md` lists `/user-resource/helixscreen/logs/helix.log` for the CC1, but the open file is what counts); three recent app lines. A missing switch or `log: none`: stop and report.

Idle baseline (no saver forced), three runs:

```bash
for run in 1 2 3; do scripts/screensaver-perf/embedded_gate.sh cc1-fireworks "$run" off; done
```

Then each fireworks level, one level at a time:

```bash
scripts/device-env-set.sh "root@$HELIX_PERF_HOST" "$ENV_FILE" HELIX_SCREENSAVER_NOW fireworks
level=0   # then 1, 2 and 3
scripts/device-env-set.sh "root@$HELIX_PERF_HOST" "$ENV_FILE" HELIX_SCREENSAVER_LEVEL "$level"
restart_cc1
```

Wait with a Monitor until-loop on `perf_ssh "grep -c 'Type 4 running at level $level' $LOG"` becoming non-zero; zero after 60 s means the build or env did not take: stop and report. Then:

```bash
for run in 1 2 3; do scripts/screensaver-perf/embedded_gate.sh cc1-fireworks "$run" "level$level"; done
```

After level 3, summarize and compare with the budget (`budget_vs_gate.py` from Step 4):

```bash
python3 scripts/screensaver-perf/summarize.py "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/results/cc1-fireworks.txt" > "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/cc1-fireworks_summary.txt"
cores=$(perf_ssh 'grep -c ^processor /proc/cpuinfo')
python3 "$SS_SCRATCH/budget_vs_gate.py" embedded "$cores" cc1-fireworks "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/results/cc1-fireworks.txt" | tee "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/cc1-fireworks_budget.txt"
```

Each gate prints its RESULT line; `summarize.py` gives PASS or FAIL per level under the load-gate rule, and the budget file one line per level with any `FLAG`.

Eye check on the CC1 during the level-0 runs: before starting them, tell Preston "The CC1 display now shows fireworks at level 0; please look for banding in the sky gradient and in fading sparks. The 16-bit dither should show a fine even grain, not stripes."

Restore the installed build and its env file, confirm the version is back, and release:

```bash
tar -tf "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/cc1-install-before.tar" | grep -q -x 'bin/helix-screen' || exit 1
perf_ssh "/etc/init.d/helixscreen stop"
perf_ssh "cd $HELIX_PERF_INSTALL && for d in \$(ls -A | grep -v -x -E 'config|logs'); do rm -rf \"\$d\"; done && tar -xf -" < "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/cc1-install-before.tar"; echo "restore exit $?"
perf_ssh "cat > $ENV_FILE" < "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/cc1-env-before.txt"
perf_ssh "/etc/init.d/helixscreen start"
perf_ssh "$HELIX_PERF_INSTALL/bin/helix-screen --version 2>&1 | head -n 1" | diff - "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/cc1-version-before.txt"; echo "version diff exit $?"
```

Expected: `restore exit 0` and `version diff exit 0`; then `scripts/helix-claim release device:cc1`. Anything else: keep the claim, tell Preston the recorded version, and redeploy that release before releasing.

Report to Preston: the summary table (helix CPU and load-gate p99 and max per level against idle), which levels pass, `cc1-fireworks_budget.txt` with any `FLAG` lines, and his eye verdict.

- [ ] **Step 8: AD5M checkpoint and measurement**

Ask Preston the same question for the AD5M (its address, the same load, about 20 minutes, not printing), and wait for his yes. Then claim it, check it is idle, and find the install the deploy overwrites. The AD5M can hold two installs and the running process may come from the other one, so the directory comes from the device profile the deploy itself uses:

```bash
scripts/helix-claim check device:ad5m && scripts/helix-claim take device:ad5m "fireworks measurement" --note "measurement build, busy loops and wake-up probe"
export HELIX_PERF_HOST=<AD5M address from the device roster> HELIX_PERF_USER=root
unset HELIX_PERF_PASSWORD   # key auth
curl -s "http://$HELIX_PERF_HOST:7125/printer/objects/query?print_stats=state"
export HELIX_PERF_INSTALL=$(scripts/device-profile.sh "root@$HELIX_PERF_HOST" -o ConnectTimeout=5 2>/dev/null | sed -n 's/^INSTALL_DIR=//p' | head -n 1)
echo "install: ${HELIX_PERF_INSTALL:-none}"
. scripts/screensaver-perf/perf_env.sh
ENV_FILE=$(perf_ssh "for f in $HELIX_PERF_INSTALL/config/helixscreen.env /etc/helixscreen/helixscreen.env; do [ -f \$f ] && { echo \$f; break; }; done")
ENV_EXISTED=yes
if [ -z "$ENV_FILE" ]; then
    ENV_EXISTED=no
    ENV_FILE=$HELIX_PERF_INSTALL/config/helixscreen.env
    perf_ssh "mkdir -p $HELIX_PERF_INSTALL/config && : > $ENV_FILE"
fi
INIT_SCRIPT=$(perf_ssh "for f in /etc/init.d/S80helixscreen /etc/init.d/S90helixscreen; do [ -f \$f ] && { echo \$f; break; }; done")
echo "env file: $ENV_FILE (existed: $ENV_EXISTED); init script: ${INIT_SCRIPT:-none}"
```

Expected: the claim succeeds; `print_stats.state` is not `printing` or `paused` (otherwise stop and tell Preston); an install path (on the Forge-X rig, `/opt/config/mod/.bin/helixscreen`; `none` stops the step). The launcher reads the first of `<install>/config/helixscreen.env` and `/etc/helixscreen/helixscreen.env` that exists (`scripts/helix-launcher.sh`), so that file is the one changed and restored. `deploy-ad5m` can rewrite the init script from the build, so it is snapshotted too.

Record and snapshot the install, the env file and the init script:

```bash
perf_ssh "$HELIX_PERF_INSTALL/bin/helix-screen --version 2>&1 | head -n 1" > "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/ad5m-version-before.txt"
cat "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/ad5m-version-before.txt"
perf_ssh "cd $HELIX_PERF_INSTALL && tar -cf - \$(ls -A | grep -v -x -E 'config|logs')" > "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/ad5m-install-before.tar"; echo "snapshot exit $?"
tar -tf "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/ad5m-install-before.tar" | grep -c -x 'bin/helix-screen'
perf_ssh "cat $ENV_FILE" > "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/ad5m-env-before.txt"
[ -z "$INIT_SCRIPT" ] || perf_ssh "cat $INIT_SCRIPT" > "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/ad5m-init-before.txt"
```

Expected: a version line, `snapshot exit 0` and `1`. Anything else: stop before deploying.

Build, check the build carries fireworks alone, and deploy to that directory:

```bash
make ad5m-docker ENABLE_SCREENSAVER=yes NPROC_DOCKER_RUN="$JOBS" > "$SS_SCRATCH/ad5m-docker.log" 2>&1; echo "exit $?"
for s in 'Starting fireworks' 'Starting flying toasters' 'Starting starfield' 'Starting 3D pipes'; do
  printf '%s: ' "$s"; strings -a build/ad5m/bin/helix-screen | grep -c "$s"
done
make deploy-ad5m AD5M_HOST="$HELIX_PERF_HOST" AD5M_SSH_TARGET="root@$HELIX_PERF_HOST" AD5M_DEPLOY_DIR="$HELIX_PERF_INSTALL" > "$SS_SCRATCH/deploy-ad5m.log" 2>&1; echo "exit $?"
restart_ad5m() { perf_ssh "killall helix-watchdog helix-screen helix-splash 2>/dev/null; sleep 1; cd $HELIX_PERF_INSTALL && ./bin/helix-launcher.sh >/dev/null 2>&1 &"; }
export HELIX_PERF_PROBE=build/screensaver-perf/wakeup_probe-armv7 DUR=60
```

Expected: both makes `exit 0`; fireworks `1` and the others `0`. The probe is the static armv7 build from Step 7; `restart_ad5m` is the launcher command `deploy-ad5m` itself uses.

Set the pacing switches and the log level, restart, and find the log:

```bash
scripts/device-env-set.sh "root@$HELIX_PERF_HOST" "$ENV_FILE" HELIX_EGL_VSYNC 1
scripts/device-env-set.sh "root@$HELIX_PERF_HOST" "$ENV_FILE" HELIX_LOOP_MIN_SLEEP_MS 1
scripts/device-env-set.sh "root@$HELIX_PERF_HOST" "$ENV_FILE" HELIX_LOG_LEVEL info
restart_ad5m
```

Wait with a Monitor until-loop on `perf_ssh 'pidof helix-screen'` printing a pid (60 s at most), then:

```bash
perf_ssh 'tr "\000" "\n" < /proc/$(pidof helix-screen | cut -d" " -f1)/environ | grep -E "^HELIX_(EGL_VSYNC|LOOP_MIN_SLEEP_MS)="'
LOG=$(perf_app_log); echo "log: ${LOG:-none}"
perf_ssh "tail -n 3 $LOG"
```

Expected: `HELIX_EGL_VSYNC=1` and `HELIX_LOOP_MIN_SLEEP_MS=1`; a log path, found from the file the app holds open (`docs/devel/LOGGING.md` lists `/data/helixscreen/logs/helix.log` for Forge-X, and `perf_app_log` falls back to `/var/log/messages` only when the app writes there); three recent app lines. A missing switch or `log: none`: stop and report.

Idle baseline, three runs:

```bash
for run in 1 2 3; do scripts/screensaver-perf/embedded_gate.sh ad5m-fireworks "$run" off; done
```

Each fireworks level, one at a time:

```bash
scripts/device-env-set.sh "root@$HELIX_PERF_HOST" "$ENV_FILE" HELIX_SCREENSAVER_NOW fireworks
level=0   # then 1, 2 and 3
scripts/device-env-set.sh "root@$HELIX_PERF_HOST" "$ENV_FILE" HELIX_SCREENSAVER_LEVEL "$level"
restart_ad5m
```

Wait with a Monitor until-loop on `perf_ssh "grep -c 'Type 4 running at level $level' $LOG"` becoming non-zero; zero after 60 s: stop and report. Then:

```bash
for run in 1 2 3; do scripts/screensaver-perf/embedded_gate.sh ad5m-fireworks "$run" "level$level"; done
```

After level 3:

```bash
python3 scripts/screensaver-perf/summarize.py "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/results/ad5m-fireworks.txt" > "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/ad5m-fireworks_summary.txt"
cores=$(perf_ssh 'grep -c ^processor /proc/cpuinfo')
python3 "$SS_SCRATCH/budget_vs_gate.py" embedded "$cores" ad5m-fireworks "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/results/ad5m-fireworks.txt" | tee "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/ad5m-fireworks_budget.txt"
```

Restore the install, env file and init script, confirm the version, and release:

```bash
tar -tf "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/ad5m-install-before.tar" | grep -q -x 'bin/helix-screen' || exit 1
perf_ssh "killall helix-watchdog helix-screen helix-splash 2>/dev/null; sleep 1"
perf_ssh "cd $HELIX_PERF_INSTALL && for d in \$(ls -A | grep -v -x -E 'config|logs'); do rm -rf \"\$d\"; done && tar -xf -" < "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/ad5m-install-before.tar"; echo "restore exit $?"
if [ "$ENV_EXISTED" = yes ]; then perf_ssh "cat > $ENV_FILE" < "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/ad5m-env-before.txt"; else perf_ssh "rm -f $ENV_FILE"; fi
[ -z "$INIT_SCRIPT" ] || perf_ssh "cat > $INIT_SCRIPT" < "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/ad5m-init-before.txt"
restart_ad5m
perf_ssh "$HELIX_PERF_INSTALL/bin/helix-screen --version 2>&1 | head -n 1" | diff - "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/ad5m-version-before.txt"; echo "version diff exit $?"
```

Expected: `restore exit 0` and `version diff exit 0`; then `scripts/helix-claim release device:ad5m`. Anything else: keep the claim, tell Preston the recorded version, and redeploy that release before releasing. Report the summary table, `ad5m-fireworks_budget.txt` and the passing levels as for the CC1.

- [ ] **Step 9: Put the budget numbers to Preston**

The design has the load gate on the Pi 3B and the CC1 confirm or correct the budget (`saver_budget_share`: 4 or more cores 50%, 3 cores 37%, 2 cores 25%, 1 core 10%). Collect the comparisons:

```bash
cat "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/fireworks_pi3b_budget.txt" "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/cc1-fireworks_budget.txt" "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH/ad5m-fireworks_budget.txt"
grep -h '^FLAG' "$HELIX_PERF_SCRATCH"/*_budget.txt
```

For each board, the evidence for its core count is the net CPU of its most expensive level that passes the gate (the budget may sit at or above it) and of its cheapest level that fails (the budget must sit below it). With no `FLAG` line and every pair on the right side of the current number, tell Preston the measurements confirm the budget and name the pairs. Otherwise propose, for each core count a board measured, a whole percent between its two figures, with the rows behind it and the `THERMAL` summaries (a throttled Pi run understates what the board affords), and ask him to choose. A core count no board measured keeps its number.

Change nothing he has not approved. If he approves new numbers, set them in `src/ui/screensaver_gate.cpp#saver_budget_share`, in the test `the saver budget follows the core count and halves while printing` (`tests/unit/test_screensaver_gate.cpp`), and in `docs/devel/SCREENSAVERS.md` where it states the budget (`grep -n '37%' docs/devel/SCREENSAVERS.md`); build the tests, run `./build/bin/helix-tests "[screensaver_gate]"`, then commit with `BUDGETS` set to the approved numbers as text:

```bash
.venv/bin/clang-format -i src/ui/screensaver_gate.cpp tests/unit/test_screensaver_gate.cpp
git add -- src/ui/screensaver_gate.cpp tests/unit/test_screensaver_gate.cpp docs/devel/SCREENSAVERS.md
git commit -m "fix(screensaver): gate budget per core count from the load-gate measurements" -m "The Pi 3B, CC1 and AD5M fireworks runs under the load gate put the saver budget at $BUDGETS: the most expensive level each board runs within the gate stays inside it, and the cheapest level it cannot run stays outside." -m "Mutation: the previous number restored for one changed core count; the saver budget test went red"
```

- [ ] **Step 10: Completion gates**

Run the full suite and mutation gate in the foreground, one at a time:

```bash
make test-run > "$SS_SCRATCH/test-run.log" 2>&1; echo "exit $?"
make mutate-diff > "$SS_SCRATCH/mutate-diff.log" 2>&1; echo "exit $?"
grep -n -E '^base |^diff |SURVIVED|NOT COVERED|CLEAN|INCOMPLETE' "$SS_SCRATCH/mutate-diff.log"
```

Expected: `make test-run` exits 0. For `make mutate-diff`, first check the `base` line names the branch this work was cut from; for every `SURVIVED` hunk either add the test that kills it (its own commit, with a `Mutation:` line) or confirm it is one of the four survivors this plan expects on a STANDARD test host: the tier expression in `DisplaySettingsManager::init_subjects` (named in the Task 7 commit), the removal of the toasters' tier input in Task 6 (the lowest ladder rung keeps the cap), the `set_host` call in `DisplayManager::init` (proven on the Pi 3B in Task 6 Step 13), and the hide-before-free order in `SaverCanvas::release` (Task 3 Step 13). List every survivor, expected or not, in the report to Preston. `NOT COVERED` paths under `lib/` or `tests/` are expected.

ASAN runs on zeus against a pushed commit. Ask Preston before pushing the branch; after he agrees:

```bash
git push -u origin HEAD
scripts/zeus-run.sh asan '[screensaver_parts],[pixel_writer],[fireworks_sim],[screensaver_fireworks],[starfield_sim],[screensaver_canvas],[screensaver_gate]' > "$SS_SCRATCH/zeus-asan.log" 2>&1; echo "exit $?"
grep -n -E 'ERROR: AddressSanitizer|test cases|assertions' "$SS_SCRATCH/zeus-asan.log"
```

Expected: `exit 0`, no `ERROR: AddressSanitizer`, and a Catch2 totals line with a non-zero test-case count (an ASAN run that prints no totals ran nothing). No TSAN run: the work adds no threads.

- [ ] **Step 11: Remove the plan documents in the shipping change**

The durable knowledge now lives in `docs/devel/SCREENSAVERS.md`, `docs/devel/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md`, the user docs and the code. In the change that ships the work (the merge of this branch), delete the spec and this plan:

```bash
grep -rn '2026-09-14-screensaver-gating-fireworks' docs --include=*.md; echo "references exit $?"
rm docs/devel/plans/2026-09-14-screensaver-gating-fireworks-design.md docs/devel/plans/2026-09-14-screensaver-gating-fireworks.md
git add -- docs/devel/plans/2026-09-14-screensaver-gating-fireworks-design.md docs/devel/plans/2026-09-14-screensaver-gating-fireworks.md
git commit -m "docs(screensaver): drop the gating and fireworks spec and plan now the work has shipped" -m "The registry, foundation, gate and fireworks are described in docs/devel/SCREENSAVERS.md, the switches in ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md and the settings in the user docs; the Pi 3B, CC1 and AD5M measurements are in the branch's commit messages and the report to Preston." -m "Mutation: none; documentation only"
```

Expected: the reference grep prints only lines inside the two files being deleted (`references exit 0` with those two paths), and the commit removes both files. If any other doc cites them, fix that citation in the same commit.
