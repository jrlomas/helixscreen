# Filament Slot Metadata — Implementation Notes

HelixScreen-internal notes on how we persist per-slot filament overrides. For
the wire-format specification (what a third-party reader or writer needs to
know about the `lane_data` namespace), see
[`../specs/filament_slots.md`](../specs/filament_slots.md). This doc describes
the code that puts records there and reads them back, and assumes familiarity
with the public spec.

---

## 1. Overview

HelixScreen stores per-slot filament overrides — user-edited metadata (brand,
spool name, Spoolman binding, weights, color name) plus color/material — in
the Moonraker `lane_data` namespace following the AFC convention. This doc
describes the internal implementation: architecture, per-backend integration,
lifetime discipline, testing patterns, and the one-shot migration from our
pre-spec legacy namespaces.

The public format is covered by [`../specs/filament_slots.md`](../specs/filament_slots.md);
don't duplicate field semantics here.

All four HelixScreen-managed backends (IFS, Snapmaker, ACE, CFS) emit the
AFC-standard `lane` / `color` / `material` / `vendor` / `spool_id` /
`scan_time` / `bed_temp` / `nozzle_temp` fields (where a source value is
available) in addition to HelixScreen's extension fields. This makes every
slot edit in HelixScreen round-trip to OrcaSlicer 2.3.2+ with no extra
configuration on the slicer side — the convention is shared, not
HelixScreen-specific.

**Two-string material identity.** OrcaSlicer matches a lane to a preset by the
`material` string alone, and an unmatched string resolves to a Generic PLA
preset (wrong temperatures), not a near miss. So `to_lane_data_record()` emits
`material` as a **slicer-matchable** string produced by
`filament::orca_match_type()` (`src/printer/filament_variants.cpp`) — explicit
`orca_type_overrides` entry → exact `orca_library_types` entry →
`extract_base_material()` base polymer → the field is **omitted** when nothing
matches — and separately emits `helix_material`, the user's precise identity
(`ASA-GF`, `PLA Silk`), written unconditionally. `from_lane_data_record()`
prefers `helix_material`, so HelixScreen's own screen keeps the exact type even
though Orca sees the reduced `material`. The library-type set and override table
are generated into `assets/filaments.json` by `scripts/import_orca_filaments.py`
and pre-warmed on the main thread at startup (`filament::warm_orca_tables()`)
so the first lookup never parses the asset on a WebSocket background thread. See
[`FILAMENT_MANAGEMENT.md`](FILAMENT_MANAGEMENT.md) § "Two-string identity" for
the full resolution order and the OrcaSlicer fallback mechanism.

## 2. Architecture

The persistence plumbing lives in three places:

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `include/filament_slot_override.h` | `FilamentSlotOverride` plain struct — one record's worth of fields, plus `to_lane_data_record` / `from_lane_data_record` for the wire shape. |
| `include/filament_slot_override_store.h` | `FilamentSlotOverrideStore` class — per-backend instance that owns the MR-DB I/O, the local cache file, and the migration helper. |
| `src/printer/filament_slot_override_store.cpp` | Implementation: `load_blocking`, `save_async`, `clear_async`, `cache_path`, plus the `try_migrate_legacy` helper and the free `read_cache` / `write_cache_slot` functions. |

Each backend owns one `FilamentSlotOverrideStore` instance keyed by its
`backend_id`, plus the `overrides_` map that store was loaded into. The
`backend_id` isolates backends so they cannot stomp each other's records, and
so the local cache file can round-trip all of them without collision.

| Backend | `backend_id` | Namespace |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| `AmsBackendAd5xIfs` | `ifs` | `lane_data` (shared) |
| `AmsBackendSnapmaker` | `snapmaker` | `lane_data` (shared) |
| `AmsBackendAce` | `ace` | `lane_data` (shared) |
| `AmsBackendCfs` | `cfs` | `lane_data` (shared) |
| `AmsBackendToolChanger` | `toolchanger` | `lane_data` (shared) |
| `AmsBackendAfc` | `afc` | `helix-screen-afc-overrides` (private) |
| `AmsBackendHappyHare` | `happyhare` | `helix-screen-hh-overrides` (private) |

AFC and Happy Hare must name a private namespace: their own Klipper plugins own
`lane_data` and rewrite it on boot, so records left there do not survive and the
plugin's own load back as if the user had authored them.

`AmsBackendQidi` holds no store - QIDI Box persists slot identity through its own
firmware (`SAVE_VARIABLE VARIABLE=filament_slot{n}`), not through this layer.

### Acquiring the store

`helix::ams::make_loaded_override_store()` builds the store and loads it in one
call, returning both halves in a `LoadedOverrideStore`:

```cpp
auto loaded = helix::ams::make_loaded_override_store(api_, "happyhare", get_type(),
                                                     backend_log_tag(), OVERRIDE_NAMESPACE);
{
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
    override_store_ = std::move(loaded.store);
    overrides_ = std::move(loaded.overrides);
}
```

A store whose load never ran is not a state any backend wants, and this is the
only way to get one, so that half-built version has no spelling. Call it with no
lock held - the round-trip blocks for up to 5s and the status subscription is
already live - and publish both fields under the lock afterwards.

`AmsBackendHappyHare` uses the helper. The other six still hand-write the
equivalent block in their own `on_started()` and are a straight follow-up
conversion; the helper's signature already covers every one of them (the only
variations are `backend_id`, the namespace, and whether the caller does extra
work with the store afterwards - AD5X IFS also reads the seated-lane scalar,
ToolChanger re-layers onto slots built before the load).

### Key methods

| Method | Threading | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `load_blocking()` | Called once from backend init, blocks the backend thread | Fetch `lane_data` from MR DB; on error/timeout, fall back to the local JSON cache. Returns `unordered_map<int, FilamentSlotOverride>`. Also triggers `try_migrate_legacy` if `lane_data` is empty and legacy namespaces have data, and runs the one-shot **material heal** (below). |
| `save_async(slot, override, cb)` | Main thread → HttpExecutor | POST the record to `lane_data/<key>` (see **Outer key style** below), refresh the local cache on success. Retries are the caller's responsibility. |
| `clear_async(slot, cb)` | Main thread → HttpExecutor | DELETE the slot's `lane_data` entry and drop it from the local cache. |

### Outer key style

The outer Moonraker DB key is **not** always `laneN`. `format_lane_key()` picks
between two shapes with **different bases**, and the store's style comes from
`lane_key_style_for(AmsType)` (`include/filament_slot_override_store.h`):

| Style | Key | Base | Used by |
|-------|-----|------|---------|
| `LaneKeyStyle::Lane` | `laneN` | **1-based** (`lane1` is slot 0) | every filament-switching system — AFC, Happy Hare, ACE, CFS, IFS |
| `LaneKeyStyle::Tool` | `T<n>` | **0-based** (`T0` is slot 0) | tool changers — Snapmaker, generic `TOOL_CHANGER` |

The inner `"lane"` field is 0-based in **both**, so the offset between the outer
key and the inner field is deliberate for `laneN` and absent for `T<n>`. Changing
one base without the other silently breaks interop with every other reader.

Tool-changer backends that predate the `T<n>` style carry a one-shot
`try_migrate_lane_keys_to_tool_keys()` at load: any `laneN` record HelixScreen
itself authored is rewritten as `T<n>` (or dropped when the canonical `T<n>`
already exists). Records it cannot prove it wrote are left alone.
| `cache_path()` | Pure | Returns `helix::get_user_config_dir() / "filament_slot_overrides.json"`. |

### Load behavior

`load_blocking` is a sync-over-async bridge. It fires a Moonraker DB request
and waits up to 5s (tunable via `load_timeout_`) on a `std::condition_variable`
backed by a `shared_ptr<SyncState>`. Moonraker's request tracker can still
fire the response callback up to ~60s later, which is why the rendezvous
state is kept alive via `shared_ptr` — a late callback harmlessly flips flags
on the still-living state. If the request completes with data, we take it.
If it errors or times out, we fall back to `read_cache()` for this backend's
entries. The cache is the offline-fallback view, never authoritative — a
successful MR fetch always supersedes it.

### Lifetime safety

MR DB callbacks can fire up to ~60 seconds after the initial call, long after
a store could be destroyed during teardown or reconfiguration. The store
avoids capturing `this` in HTTP callbacks and instead captures values plus a
`shared_ptr<SyncState>` for the sync-over-async bridge. The pattern:

```cpp
auto state = std::make_shared<SyncState>();
api_->db_get("lane_data", [state](const auto& result) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lk(state->m);
    state->result = result;
    state->done = true;
    state->cv.notify_one();
});
// block up to timeout on state->cv
```

The `state` shared_ptr keeps the rendezvous alive even if the store is
destroyed between the call and the late callback. This is an intentional
alternative to `AsyncLifetimeGuard` — the store doesn't own a UI and doesn't
need lifetime-gated UI updates; it just needs its one response slot to survive.

## 3. Per-backend integration

Each backend ties its `FilamentSlotOverrideStore` into its parse path and its
own hardware-event signal:

| Backend | Backend ID | Parse hook | Hardware-event signal | Override-exclusive fields |
|---------|------------|------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| `AmsBackendAd5xIfs` | `ifs` | `update_slot_from_state` → `apply_resolved_lane` | `Adventurer5M.json` color RGB change | brand, spool_name, spoolman_id, spoolman_vendor_id, weights, color_name |
| `AmsBackendSnapmaker` | `snapmaker` | tail loop at end of `handle_status_update` | `filament_detect.info[ch].CARD_UID` byte-array → canonicalized string | spool_name, spoolman_id, spoolman_vendor_id, remaining_weight_g |
| `AmsBackendAce` | `ace` | `parse_ace_object` per-slot loop | Status transition: EMPTY/UNKNOWN → present | brand, spool_name, spoolman_id, spoolman_vendor_id, weights, color_name |
| `AmsBackendCfs` | `cfs` | `handle_status_update` tail loop | Composite `material_type\|color_value` fingerprint | spool_name, spoolman_id, spoolman_vendor_id, remaining_weight_g |
| `AmsBackendToolChanger` | `toolchanger` | `handle_status_update` tail loop, `initialize_tools()` tail, and after the start-time load | **None** - see below | *every* field |
| `AmsBackendAfc` | `afc` | `parse_afc_stepper` and the `lane_data` query parse | AFC's own firmware clears | brand, color_name, spoolman filament/vendor ids |
| `AmsBackendHappyHare` | `happyhare` | `gate_spool_id` loop in `handle_status_update` | Gate-map spool id change | brand, spool_name, total_weight_g, color_name, spoolman filament/vendor ids |

"Override-exclusive fields" are the fields the user can edit on that backend
but the firmware never supplies — they always come from the override, never
fall through.

### Tool Changer is the odd one out

Every other backend layers overrides over something the machine reports, and
clears them when the hardware says the spool physically changed. klipper-toolchanger
does neither, and both halves of that are load-bearing:

- **The store is the sole source of filament identity, not a layer over one.**
  `parse_tool_state()` reads `mounted` and `active` and nothing else - no
  material, colour, brand or weight exists to fall through to. So "override-exclusive
  fields" is every field, and the merge is trivially "the override wins".
- **There is deliberately no hardware-event clearing.** Nothing on a tool changer
  can tell that a user swapped a spool - no RFID, no presence transition, no
  colour reading. So `clear_slot_override()` stays the inherited no-op. That is a
  decision, not an omission: inventing a clear signal here would throw away user
  data on an event that does not mean what it would have to mean.
- **The wipe it fixes is `initialize_tools()`**, which resets every slot to
  `AMS_DEFAULT_SLOT_COLOR` with the tool name as a placeholder `spool_name`, and
  runs on every `set_discovered_tools()`. Overrides are therefore re-layered at
  three points, not just the parse tail: that function's own tail, the parse
  tail, and immediately after the start-time load (because `set_discovered_tools()`
  runs before `start()`, so the slots predate the loaded overrides).
- **`T<n>` outer keys** (`lane_key_style_for`) are shared with Mainsail #2510's
  records rather than duplicating them.

Every lane-holding backend implements it — IFS, Snapmaker, ACE, CFS, AFC, Happy
Hare and the mock: reset the lane to machine readings
(`reset_lane_to_machine_readings()`), erase the in-memory entry, reset the
override-exclusive fields on the live slot (brand, spool name, Spoolman ids,
weights, colour name, catalog pick) so the clear shows on the next
`get_slot_info()`, and fire `clear_async` against the backend's own private
namespace. The mock keeps no override records, so its implementation is the
lane reset and the slot-changed event alone. QIDI Box holds no store and its
clear is a warn-only stub: the box's `SAVE_VARIABLE`s are the record, so a
clear has to zero them through firmware rather than through this layer (§2).
Colour and material are left standing, because those come from the
parse and the lane's firmware values should surface. The `lane_data` records
their Klipper plugins write are a separate thing and HelixScreen does not touch
them. For AFC that is not merely etiquette: AFC.py `delete_lane_data()`
wipes the whole namespace at the start of every PREP and refills it one lane at
a time, so the namespace is non-durable across reboots *and* transiently
incomplete during them. AFC/HH overrides go to a private namespace
(`OVERRIDE_NAMESPACE`) — see prestonbrown/helixscreen#1158.

---

## 4. Local cache

- **File**: `helix::get_user_config_dir() / "filament_slot_overrides.json"`
- **Format**: top-level `"version": 1`, then keys by backend_id, each holding
  a `"slots"` object keyed by stringified slot index:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "ifs": {
    "slots": {
      "0": { "brand": "Polymaker", "color_name": "Orange", ... },
      "2": { "brand": "Hatchbox", ... }
    }
  },
  "cfs": {
    "slots": {
      "0": { "spool_name": "...", "remaining_weight_g": 850.0 }
    }
  }
}
```

- **Write**: atomic — write to `.tmp` sibling, then `std::filesystem::rename`
  into place. Any failure along the way leaves the previous file untouched.
- **Read**: only when the MR DB fetch fails in `load_blocking`. Never
  authoritative — it exists so a first-boot-after-reconnect on a flaky
  network doesn't lose the user's view of recent edits.
- **Scope**: per-user, persists across app restarts. Not synced between
  HelixScreen instances — MR DB is the shared source of truth.

---

## 5. Merge policy

The merge rule (firmware vs stored record) is documented in
[`../specs/filament_slots.md`](../specs/filament_slots.md#5-merge-policy).
Implementation-side a stored record is not merged into a `SlotInfo` at all. It
is translated into per-source lane records, and the resolver ranks those
against what firmware states on the current frame.

`ingest_legacy_records()`
(`src/printer/lane_legacy_migration.cpp#ingest_legacy_records`) runs once per backend
from its init path, immediately after `load_blocking()`. It hands each parsed
record to `sources_from_record()`
(`src/printer/lane_translation.cpp#sources_from_record`), which splits one
record into the several sources it may legitimately speak for, and files each
through that source's own funnel: the `LocalUser` part through
`commit_slot_edit()`, everything else through `ingest()`. The split is by what
the record says about authorship, not by whether a field holds a value. The
first row below settles a linked record on its own; the rest are how an
unlinked one is split:

| What the record holds | Filed as |
|-----------------------|----------|
| a `spool_id` above zero | `Spoolman` for the whole identity, except a colour the record's `helix_declared` names, which is `LocalUser`: the colour ladder puts a person above the server. A `helix_locked_*` key on a linked record is not read, since a release 1.0 writer set it on links and meter flushes alike |
| a field named in the record's `helix_declared` set, colour and material included | `LocalUser`. A declaration stands over a value the record carries, for every field alike: a clear is not a declaration but "whatever the machine reports", so a field the record holds nothing in is never declared, and a name for it in the set (a record written by a build that recorded clears) reads as no declaration |
| on a record with no `spool_id`, a colour or material its `helix_declared` does not name, beside a `helix_locked_*` key present and true **on the wire** | `LocalUser`: how a record written before the set could name colour and material is read. Absent or false is `Remembered` |
| `catalog_id` / `product_name` | `LocalUser` regardless of what the record declares: firmware has no concept of a catalog product, so a value there can only be a pick |
| anything else the record carries | `Remembered`, which the resolver ranks **below** the current firmware frame |
| `remaining_weight_g` / `total_weight_g` | `Metered`, always: a weight is a measurement whoever wrote it |

A lane's stored record is amended from each changed Spoolman filing, through
`AmsBackend::persist_external_identity()`
(`include/ams_backend.h#AmsBackend/persist_external_identity`). It takes the
identity the server states, leaves a declared colour, the weights, the catalog
pick and the temperatures alone, claims no authorship, and writes nothing to
firmware. A lane with no record gets none: a filing is not an edit.

A record written before `helix_declared` existed carries no set, and its brand,
spool name and vendor id count as declared only beside a colour or material
declaration the same record carries. That declaration is the evidence a person
edited the record at all, since the auto-mirror declares neither and can
populate none of those three.

Each backend's parse then ends with `apply_resolved_lane()`
(`include/ams_backend.h#AmsBackend/apply_resolved_lane`), which lays
`resolve()`'s answer onto the `SlotInfo` the parse just built. Only fields some
source actually observed are written, so a field no source spoke to keeps the
backend's own value, and the fields the resolver does not own (tool mapping,
extruder name, endless-spool group, error, environment, remaining length, temps,
indices) are left exactly as the backend set them.

Beside that ranking sit the two cross-field rules that can invalidate a lane's
declared identity outright. Both are `classify_binding()`
(`src/printer/lane_binding.cpp#classify_binding`), a pure function over the lane's
sources and one `BindingReading`; `reconcile_binding()` applies its verdict by
dropping the records that declared the broken binding (`Spoolman`, `LocalUser`
and `Remembered`, leaving `Sensed`, `VendorCache` and `Metered` alone), and the
backend clears its persisted copy with `clear_persisted_override()` so the
record does not come back at the next start.

- **Rule 1 — external re-bind.** Firmware reports a positive `spoolman_id`
  different from the one the lane's declaring sources name → verdict `Rebound`.
  Not gated by any capability or setting; can fire on any backend whose
  firmware reports a positive spool id (AFC, Happy Hare, and flat-schema CFS,
  which parses a per-slot id). Our own in-flight writes are exempt: backends
  call `AmsBackend::record_own_spool_write()` at the write site, and
  `AmsBackend::reconcile_lane_binding()` feeds
  `AmsBackend::own_write_expectation()` into `BindingReading`'s own-write pair:
  the id firmware last reported before the write and the just-written id do not
  fire; a third id fires and consumes the expectation.
- **Rule 2 — eject.** `AmsBackend::printer_reports_spool_ids()` (true only
  on AFC and Happy Hare) arms **only** this rule: there a firmware id ≤ 0
  while the lane still declares a positive id is the plugin's own eject
  signal, and it clears only when the `ams/keep_spool_info_on_eject`
  setting is off (default on — "Keep Spool Info on Eject" toggle in the AMS
  Management overlay, shown only where the capability is true). Caveat: with
  AFC's own retention on (`remember_spool = true` everywhere) firmware never
  reports the eject zero, so this rule cannot fire and the toggle is a no-op —
  `printer_retains_spool_info()` detects that shape and the overlay disables
  the toggle with a note instead.

The id `classify_binding()` compares against must be firmware's own standing
word for the lane, never a `SlotInfo` field: `apply_resolved_lane()` writes the
lane's resolved `spoolman_id` back into that struct, so a caller reading it
would compare a record against itself and no binding could ever look broken.

**Exactly one reader may consume an own-write expectation.**
`own_write_expectation()` is single-shot: the frame that matches the written id
erases the entry. It has to be consumed at the site that sees firmware's own
spool id and nowhere else, or the expectation ends an id early and the next
frame reads our own in-flight write as somebody else's re-bind.
`reconcile_lane_binding()` is its only caller, so that holds by construction
rather than by discipline.

What counts as a value the record "carries" at all, per field type:

| Field type | Treated as "nothing here" |
|------------|---------------------------|
| `std::string` | empty string |
| `int` (ids) | 0 |
| `float` (weights) | negative |
| `uint32_t` (`color_rgb`) | `color_set` false, or the value `AMS_DEFAULT_SLOT_COLOR` (`0x808080`), which is where a cleared slot and a colourless record both land |

`color_set` is why colour needs two tests rather than one: pure black is a real
filament colour, so `color_rgb == 0` cannot mean "unset". `is_declarable_color()`
(`src/printer/lane_translation.cpp#is_declarable_color`) is the second, and it is
deliberately a struct-side answer only. A producer writing `#808080` on a *wire*
is stating a grey, which `read_lane_color()` reads as an observation. When adding
a field to the struct, pick a "nothing here" value a user could never legitimately
enter for it.

---

## 6. Clear semantics

Clear Spool erases everything HelixScreen and the printer's firmware remember
about that slot; what's left afterwards is only what the hardware can
physically read right now. How close each backend gets to that bar is set by
what its firmware can be told to forget:

- **AD5X IFS, AFC, CFS on Kalico and Tool Changer** reach it — their write
  paths cover the firmware-held fields, and the tool changer's store is the
  only record there is, so dropping it erases everything.
- **Happy Hare and QIDI Box** keep firmware-side state (the gate map, the
  box's `SAVE_VARIABLE`s) past a clear for now; nuclear firmware wipes for
  both are landing on their own branches.
- **ACE, Snapmaker and stock CFS cannot** — read-only API, no empty spelling
  for a slot value, and the tag is re-read on the next probe — so their
  tag-derived and firmware-held values survive a clear.

The gesture also refuses while its lane feeds an active print
(`clear_spool_blocked_by_print()` in `include/filament_op_slot_resolver.h`):
the job holds the machine (`job_holds_machine()`) and the lane is the one at
the toolhead (`AmsBackend::slot_is_actively_loaded()`), so the material and
colour the print's own surfaces are displaying survive until the job ends.
The context menu greys the button with the reason (`ams_slot_can_clear` /
`ams_slot_clear_hint`); the dispatch guard in `ams_dispatch_backend_action()`
is the authority for a caller holding a menu rendered before the print
started. Other lanes stay clearable mid-print, and a free machine clears any
lane, loaded or not.

Four distinct clear paths, handled separately:

- **User-initiated clear.** The AMS context menu's "Clear Spool" gesture
  (`MenuAction::CLEAR_SPOOL` in `src/ui/ui_ams_detail.cpp`) is a commit first
  and a clear second, and the order is load-bearing. `AmsState::commit_slot_edit()`
  carries the arms a backend clear has no way to reach: the Spoolman server
  active-spool unlink, the identity-cache invalidation and the ToolState clear
  (bundle F2LNLQCC — clearing only the backend left the server asserting the
  spool again after a restart). Only on the commit's success does the gesture
  call `AmsBackend::clear_slot_override(slot_index)`, which drops the lane's
  standing user declarations and the persisted override record — the half an
  edit statement cannot express, because on an unlinked lane a colour pick, a
  typed weight and a colour name never engage as clears
  (prestonbrown/helixscreen#1661). The tool changer's no-op default and QIDI's
  warn-only stub keep today's behaviour there: the lane's user record stands
  until a restart.
- **Hardware-event clear.** Each backend watches its own signal (see the
  integration table) and auto-clears when the signal transitions to
  "different spool". The baseline is recorded on first observation after
  startup and NEVER triggers a clear on its own — otherwise every app launch
  would wipe overrides.
- **Binding-rule clears (re-bind / eject).** The two cross-field rules
  `classify_binding()` decides (§5) drop the lane's declaring sources and the
  backend's persisted record with them: an external re-bind (firmware reports a
  different positive spool id), or, only where `printer_reports_spool_ids()` is
  true and the setting is off, a firmware eject signal.
- **Self-wipe prevention.** When the user edits the color on IFS, the IFS
  backend pre-updates `last_firmware_color_` to the user's new RGB before
  pushing the override. Without this, the next `Adventurer5M.json` read
  would see a "color change" (because firmware still reports the original
  color briefly) and clear the override the user just saved. Snapmaker and
  CFS don't need this pre-update: `CARD_UID` and the composite fingerprint
  aren't user-editable.

---

## 7. Testing patterns

Tests live in `tests/unit/test_filament_slot_override*.cpp` and in the
per-backend `test_ams_backend_*.cpp` files. Shared patterns:

- **Friend-class test access** (per lesson L065): `Ad5xIfsTestAccess`,
  `SnapmakerTestAccess`, `AceTestAccess`, `CfsTestAccess`. These friend the
  production class and expose private hooks for seeding overrides, injecting
  a store, or driving the parse path without going through a live MR API.
- **`TmpCacheDir` RAII helper**. Overrides `HELIX_USER_CONFIG_DIR` to a
  temp directory for the test's lifetime and rm's it on teardown. Keeps
  cache writes from touching the developer's real `~/.helixscreen/`.
- **Mock hooks for MR DB**: `mock_set_db_value`, `mock_get_db_value`,
  `mock_reject_next_db_{post,delete,get}`,
  `mock_defer_next_db_{post,delete,get}` + `fire_deferred_*`. The deferred
  variants are how we exercise the "callback fires after the store is
  destroyed" lifetime regression — seed a deferred call, destroy the store,
  fire the callback, assert nothing crashes.
- **Tags**:
  - `[slow]` on any test that uses `MoonrakerAPIMock` (L052 — prevents
    parallel shard hangs when LVGL-backed subjects get torn down out of
    order).
  - `[filament_slot_override]` covers every store-related test across
    files for easy targeted runs.

---

## 8. Migration

One-shot migration from the pre-spec legacy namespaces
`helix-screen:ace_slot_overrides` and `helix-screen:cfs_slot_overrides`
into `lane_data/laneN` entries. Lives in `try_migrate_legacy` in
`src/printer/filament_slot_override_store.cpp`.

Trigger conditions (all must hold):

- `lane_data` namespace for this backend is empty
- Legacy namespace for this backend has data
- Backend is ACE or CFS (IFS and Snapmaker never used the legacy namespaces,
  so their migration path short-circuits)

The migration is idempotent: once records exist under `lane_data`, the
"`lane_data` empty" guard fails and the legacy path is skipped. After a
successful migration, the legacy MR DB entry is best-effort deleted via
`database_delete_item`, and the pre-Task-6 per-backend JSON cache file
(ace_slot_overrides.json / cfs_slot_overrides.json) is also removed from
the user config dir. Delete failures are logged at warn but do not break the
migrated result — a lingering legacy blob is harmless because the idempotence
guard would short-circuit on the next startup anyway. Migration also deletes
the legacy entry in the all-malformed-entries case so subsequent startups
don't re-scan unsalvageable data on every boot.

Migration runs inline inside `load_blocking`, before the method returns, so
the backend sees the migrated records immediately without a second round-trip.

### Material heal

Records written before the two-string split (see § 1) carry a `material` that
may not be slicer-matchable and no `helix_material`. `load_blocking` runs a
one-shot heal over the fetched `lane_data` to repair them without the user
re-editing every slot:

- **Only HelixScreen-authored records** are touched, proven by a `helix_locked_*`
  key. AFC, Happy Hare, and Mainsail share this namespace; their records are not
  ours to rewrite (same ownership rule the anomaly scanner follows).
- The record is **mutated in place** — `helix_material` set to the precise
  identity, `material` set to `orca_match_type()` of it (or erased if nothing
  matches) — so `scan_time` and any co-author's fields survive. The POST targets
  the **same key it read**, so on a `T<n>` tool-changer backend the stale `laneN`
  record is healed before the key migration moves it, and the migration carries
  the healed body.
- **Gated on `orca_tables_available()`.** A missing or stale
  `assets/filaments.json` would make `orca_match_type()` return empty for every
  input and strip `material` from every lane in one pass, so the heal skips
  entirely rather than heal against an empty table.
- **Re-runs on drift.** The gate is "resolves to a different match string than it
  carries," not "already has `helix_material`", so a later library regeneration
  that drops a type we previously matched is repaired on the next boot. It
  converges because `orca_match_type(material) == material` is a fixed point on
  its own output.
