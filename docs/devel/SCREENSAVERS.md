# Screensavers

A screensaver runs when the display dims (`DisplayManager::check_display_sleep`), covers the
panel with a full-screen overlay, and measures its own CPU cost so it never slows the printer.
This doc is the map: which file owns what, how the gate decides, and how to add a saver.

## Key files

| File | Owns |
|---|---|
| `include/screensaver_registry.h` | `ScreensaverType`, the `SCREENSAVERS` rows (type, stable name, label key, color depths), clamp, `HELIX_SCREENSAVER_NOW` names, the fresh-install default. Always compiled |

## The foundation

Every saver derives from `SaverBase` and implements `canvas_format()`, `on_start()`,
`on_frame()`, `on_stop()` and its ladder (`ladder_size()`, `ladder_period_ms()`). The base
creates the overlay, the canvas when the saver has one, seeds the saver's own random sequence,
starts the frame timer at the level's period, and invalidates the dirty areas each frame
returns. A saver that writes pixels itself returns boxes; a saver drawing with `lv_draw_*`
opens `SaverCanvas::begin_layer()`, marks what it draws with `mark_dirty()` and finishes with
`finish_layer()`. Toasters use no canvas: their sprites are LVGL images.

Every ladder starts at 16 ms (`SAVER_FAST_PERIOD`, one refresh of a 60 Hz panel), or at
`HELIX_SCREENSAVER_REFR_PERIOD_MS` when that is set for manual testing
(`SaverBase::level_period_ms`); levels 1 and up keep their declared periods either way. Starfield
and pipes then run at 33 ms; toasters at 33 ms with every sprite, then 33 ms with ten; the
bouncing printer at 33 ms, then 33 ms with its corner flash but no confetti; fireworks per
`FIREWORKS_LEVELS`. While a saver runs, `helix::RefreshPeriodHold` refreshes the display at
the saver's current period (`follow`), so the display and the saver stay equal at every level. Device measurements assume the pacing that keeps 16 ms even: EGL vsync and a 1 ms
main-loop floor, which every device run sets explicitly (`scripts/screensaver-perf/arm_measure.sh`).

Motion is a function of elapsed time (`include/screensaver_motion.h`), so a level that changes
the frame period changes nothing on screen but the frame rate, and at the toasters' lowest rung
the sprite count.

## The gate

`ScreensaverManager::on_idle_check_tick` runs on the display manager's idle-check tick and
samples `CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID` (every thread, LVGL's draw thread included) at most every
250 ms.

- While no saver runs, samples feed `IdleBaseline`: the CPU rate over the last idle stretch of
  up to 10 s, and 0 under 3 s of samples.
- A run ignores its first second, then closes a 5 s window after another for as long as it runs:
  `(cpu delta - baseline * wall) / wall` as a share of one core.
- The budget is `saver_budget_share`: 4 or more cores 50%, 3 cores 37%, 2 cores 25%, 1 core 10%,
  halved while `SaverHost::is_printing` says a print holds the machine.
- `decide_saver_level`: within budget the level stays (a run never steps up); over budget the
  saver steps down one level at its next natural break; over budget at the bottom level the run
  becomes a static black `SaverOverlay` with no frame timer.

Each step down and each too-heavy mark is stored at `/display/screensaver_levels/<name>` as
`{"level", "too_heavy", "version", "board"}`. The next run of that saver starts there, unless
`helix_version_full()` or the board fingerprint (display path, cores, bogomips to the nearest
100, resolution, color depth) differs, which starts again at level 0.

`HELIX_SCREENSAVER_BUDGET_PCT` replaces the budget and `HELIX_SCREENSAVER_LEVEL` forces a level
with the gate off (`docs/devel/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md`).

## Color depth and builds

The registry row lists the depths a saver draws at. Every saver draws both RGB565 and
XRGB8888 through `PixelWriter`, with `SAVER_BUILD_CANVAS_FORMAT` picking the display's depth
at compile time, so a 16 bpp build compiles all of them (Makefile `SCREENSAVER_16BPP_TARGETS`
is the depth-16 target list; `SCREENSAVER_32BPP_ONLY_SRCS` is the exclusion list a saver that
cannot draw 16 bpp would land on, currently empty). The two lists and the registry's depth
bits must agree.

The fresh-install default is depth-aware (`default_screensaver_type`): Flying Toasters when the
build draws at its depth, otherwise the first registered saver that does, and Off when none do.

## Adding a saver

1. Add the type to `ScreensaverType` and a row to `SCREENSAVERS` with a stable name and depths.
2. Add the label to `row_screensaver` in `ui_xml/settings_display_sound_overlay.xml` (a test
   compares it with the registry), run `make translation-sync`, translate the new key in every
   `translations/*.yml`, then `make translations` (and `make regen-text-fonts` for new CJK text).
3. Derive from `SaverBase` in `include/screensaver_<name>.h` and `src/ui/screensaver_<name>.cpp`;
   keep the scene in a pure simulation class when it writes pixels, so it is testable without a
   display. Register the factory in `ScreensaverManager::ScreensaverManager`.
4. Add the new sources to `firmware/helixscreen-esp32/components/helixapp/app_srcs_excluded.txt`
   (the Makefile screensaver filter picks up `src/ui/screensaver_*.cpp` by itself).
5. Test determinism per seed, that dirty areas cover every changed pixel, and the ladder, then
   measure the saver on a board with `scripts/screensaver-perf/`.
