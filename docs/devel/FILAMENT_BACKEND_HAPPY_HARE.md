# Happy Hare Filament Backend

Happy Hare is a Klipper add-on for ERCF, Tradrack, and other selector-based
multi-filament systems (MMUs) - one shared extruder fed by a moving selector.
Topology is `PathTopology::LINEAR`: the selector picks one gate from the spools;
slot count is the gate count from `[mmu_machine]` (multi-unit EMU rigs appear as multiple units).

## Happy Hare (MMU)

Happy Hare is a Klipper add-on for ERCF, Tradrack, and other selector-based multi-filament systems.

### Detection

Klipper object `mmu` in `printer.objects.list` sets `AmsType::HAPPY_HARE`.

### Moonraker Variables

| Variable | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `printer.mmu.gate` | int | Current gate (-1=none, -2=bypass) |
| `printer.mmu.tool` | int | Current tool number |
| `printer.mmu.filament` | string | "Loaded" or "Unloaded" |
| `printer.mmu.action` | string | "Idle", "Loading", "Unloading", "Forming Tip", etc. |
| `printer.mmu.gate_status` | int[] | Per-gate: -1=unknown, 0=empty, 1=available, 2=from_buffer |
| `printer.mmu.gate_color_rgb` | int[] | Per-gate RGB colors (0xRRGGBB) |
| `printer.mmu.gate_material` | string[] | Per-gate material names |
| `printer.mmu.filament_pos` | int | 0-8 filament position for path visualization |

### G-code Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `MMU_LOAD GATE={n}` | Load filament from gate |
| `MMU_UNLOAD` | Unload current filament |
| `MMU_SELECT GATE={n}` | Select gate without loading |
| `T{n}` | Tool change (unload + load) |
| `MMU_HOME` | Home the selector (reset). Unloads first unless already unloaded — see Reset vs Recover |
| `MMU_RECOVER` | Attempt error recovery |
| `MMU_CHECK_GATE` | Probe every gate sensor (sidebar **Check slots**). Physical: parks the toolhead and unloads/reloads each gate, and Happy Hare does not refuse it mid-print, so the sidebar gates it |
| `MMU_TTG_MAP TOOL={n} GATE={g}` | Set tool-to-gate mapping |
| `MMU_GATE_MAP GATE={n} [COLOR=..] [MATERIAL=..] [SPOOLID=..]` | Persist a slot edit to the gate map (`mmu_vars.cfg`). Omitted params keep their current value, so a field is only cleared by naming it with an explicit empty value |
| `MMU_GATE_MAP GATE={n} MATERIAL= COLOR= NAME= VENDOR= SPOOLID=-1 QUIET=1` | **Clear Spool**: wipe every field the gate map holds for one gate - see [Clear Spool](#clear-spool) |
| `MMU_SELECT_BYPASS` | Select bypass position |

### Path Topology

`PathTopology::LINEAR` -- Selector picks one input from multiple gates. Filament path: `SPOOL -> PREP -> LANE -> HUB (selector) -> OUTPUT (bowden) -> TOOLHEAD -> NOZZLE`.

Happy Hare's `filament_pos` (0-8) maps to `PathSegment` via `path_segment_from_happy_hare_pos()`.

### Capabilities

| Feature | Supported | Editable |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Endless Spool | `Available` | `Group` on a single-unit MMU; `ReadOnly` + `MultiUnit` on multi-unit, `ReadOnly` + `NotReady` before the gate registry initialises (see [Endless Spool](FILAMENT_MANAGEMENT.md#endless-spool-shared-model)) |
| Tool Mapping | Yes | Yes (via `MMU_TTG_MAP`) |
| Bypass Mode | Yes | Yes (selector position -2), when `[mmu_machine] has_bypass` is set. `has_bypass: 0` hides the UI but `MMU_SELECT_BYPASS` still works - see [the force override](FILAMENT_MANAGEMENT.md#bypass-visibility-and-the-force-override) |
| Spoolman | Yes | -- (pull mode: the gate map is Spoolman's - Clear Spool clears HelixScreen's copy only and reports partial failure) |
| Auto-Heat on Load | No | UI manages preheat |
| Dryer | Yes | `MMU_HEATER` (see [Happy Hare Specifics](FILAMENT_MANAGEMENT.md#happy-hare-specifics)) |
| Lane Eject | Yes | `supports_lane_eject()` + `eject_lane()` |

Happy Hare's endless spool is group-based and settable at runtime, not a config-file
read: `apply_endless_spool_backup()` builds a full `GROUPS=` array (one non-negative group
id per gate) and sends `MMU_ENDLESS_SPOOL QUIET=1 GROUPS=<csv>`.
`get_endless_spool_capabilities()` reports `Group` editability only when
`system_info_.units.size() <= 1`: `MMU_ENDLESS_SPOOL` has no `UNIT=` parameter and acts on
the currently-selected unit, so a client cannot reliably target one unit's groups on a
multi-unit (EMU) rig. `get_endless_spool_config()` returns the gate group as one unordered
`EndlessSpoolGroup` per group id; flattening it to per-slot arrows is the renderer's job
(see [Endless Spool](FILAMENT_MANAGEMENT.md#endless-spool-shared-model)).

**`ENABLE=` on edit vs on reset.** An edit sends **no** `ENABLE=`, and
`apply_endless_spool_backup()` refuses with `WRONG_STATE` when
`mmu.endless_spool_enabled` is false: `cmd_MMU_ENDLESS_SPOOL` ignores `GROUPS` while the
feature is off, so the write would fail silently. An unconditional `ENABLE=1` is not the
fix - it turns the feature **on**, persistently via `mmu_state_enable_endless_spool`, as a
side effect of setting one backup gate. `reset_endless_spool()` does keep
`MMU_ENDLESS_SPOOL ENABLE=1 RESET=1 QUIET=1`, because the handler early-returns before
honouring `RESET` while disabled, and `_reset_endless_spool()` then assigns *and* persists
`default_endless_spool_enabled` over the momentary enable - so there it is not a lasting
side effect.

`endless_spool_enabled` is in the `mmu` subscription field list
(`src/api/moonraker_discovery_sequence.cpp`) alongside `endless_spool_groups`. Happy Hare
publishes the bit under two keys, `endless_spool_enabled` and `endless_spool`, both tagged
DEPRECATED in mmu.py's `get_status()` with no replacement shipped, so the parse reads the
newer spelling and falls back to the older one; if a future Happy Hare drops both, the flag
keeps its last value instead of silently flipping to off. It lands in
`AmsSystemInfo::endless_spool_enabled`, which is what `caps.enabled` is derived from. Before
the first frame the flag is still false, which is why the uninitialised-registry branch
reports `Unknown` + `NotReady` rather than `Off`.

`recovers_filament_on_resume()` is **not** overridden here (default `false`), so a Happy
Hare runout gets the dialog with manual **Load** kept prominent, because Resume alone does not
re-feed. `supports_per_tool_spool_assignment()` is not overridden either; it falls through
to `is_tool_changer(get_type())`, which is false for an MMU.

### Clear Spool

Clear Spool empties everything the printer remembers about the gate, not just the
spool link. Happy Hare keeps omitted `MMU_GATE_MAP` params at their current value, so
`apply_user_edit()` detects the funnel's all-blank `SlotInfo` (and a gate that held
something) and sends one wipe:

```
MMU_GATE_MAP GATE={n} MATERIAL= COLOR= NAME= VENDOR= SPOOLID=-1 QUIET=1
```

Every writable field is named with an explicit empty value; v2/v3 ignore params they do
not fetch, and `VENDOR` is v4-only. Three params are permanently off this command:

- `RESET=1` - on v2/v3 it ignores `GATE` and wipes **every** gate.
- `TEMP=0` - falsy values mean "keep the current value".
- `AVAILABLE=0` - that marks the gate EMPTY, not unknown.

Two gates on the send itself:

- **Spoolman pull mode** (`printer.mmu.spoolman_support == "pull"`, parsed into
  `AmsSystemInfo::spoolman_mode`): Happy Hare refuses local writes to material, colour,
  name, vendor and spool id, and logs the refusal in its own console rather than
  returning an error the client could read. The backend clears HelixScreen's layer,
  sends nothing, and returns a partial failure naming Spoolman as the owner of the gate
  map.
- **Mid-print backstop.** The print UI refuses clears while a job holds the machine. If
  one reaches the backend anyway for the gate the job is printing from, the firmware
  write is skipped with a warning and a partial failure; HelixScreen's own layer is
  still cleared.

The wipe only fires when the gate held something. An all-blank edit on an already-blank
gate (a tool-map-only save) sends no `MMU_GATE_MAP` at all, so an ordinary edit on an
empty gate stays silent.

### Reset vs Recover

- **Reset** (`reset()`) sends `MMU_HOME` to home the selector. Used for general state reset.
  It is not state-only: bare `MMU_HOME` carries no `FORCE_UNLOAD`, and Happy Hare's selector
  `home()` runs its unload sequence whenever `filament_pos` is not `UNLOADED` before homing.
  Happy Hare's own `check_if_printing()` guard is on `MMU_PRELOAD` alone, so the firmware
  accepts this mid-print. Happy Hare is therefore the one backend answering
  `reset_moves_filament()` true, which is what lets the AMS sidebar grey its Reset button
  while a job owns the machine (`include/filament_op_slot_resolver.h#compute_machine_op_gating`).
- **Recover** (`recover()`) sends `MMU_RECOVER` to attempt error recovery without full re-homing.
- **Clear fault** (`clear_fault(slot_index)`) is a third, gate-scoped door onto the same command.
  Happy Hare overrides the base default (which forwards to `cancel()`): `slot_index >= 0` sends
  `MMU_RECOVER GATE=<n>`, and `slot_index < 0` (what both UI callers pass whenever nothing is
  loaded, which is the state Reset is pressed in) drops the parameter and sends bare
  `MMU_RECOVER`, re-syncing the whole selector.
